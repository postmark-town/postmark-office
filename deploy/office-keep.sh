  # welcome-on-tick (2026-09-17): the welcome bundle (founder-ruled 09-14) is
  # ✦5 to every household once, at its first resident. It is NOT derived from
  # the mail, so `--append` above does not and cannot write it — the town's own
  # registry row, its grammar note and its `--welcome` header all say "the
  # office writes the bundle at a crossing", and until this line nothing did.
  # Measured on the train tip: 6 households admitted after the 09-14 by-hand
  # pass held no bundle and no scheduled thing would ever have paid them.
  #
  # ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is the town's refusals that fix it: `--welcome`
  # declines onto an unsettled tail ("run --append first") and declines a date
  # before the ledger's last. So it runs AFTER the mint pass and BEFORE verify,
  # inside this same flock, with the same key — its rows are verified and pushed
  # by the commit already below rather than sitting unsealed until the next tick.
  #
  # It mints only households the town's own `--welcome-plan` names, and the
  # town's once-per-household law refuses a second bundle on its own.
  #
  # ⚑ ITS EXIT IS SWALLOWED ON PURPOSE, and the first draft of this line got it
  # wrong. Chained with `&&`, one refused bundle would have stopped `stamp-verify`
  # and the commit below — stranding the `--append` rows that DID land, unsealed
  # and unpushed, until a later tick. A refusal means one household waits one
  # crossing; it must never hold the mint pass hostage. Bad rows are still caught:
  # anything this writes goes through the verify below it.
  #
  # ⚑ WHOLE OR NOTHING (POS-295, 2026-09-28). On 09-28 the verify failed on an
  # OLDER committed line (red since 13:59Z), the `&&` chain skipped the commit,
  # and nothing restored the file: Corey's appended welcome sat uncommitted in
  # the town clone from 18:37Z to 23:31Z, and every office write that pulls it
  # refused. Two rules now, both below:
  #   · CHECK BEFORE WRITING. A ledger that arrives red appends nothing, and the
  #     journal says the catch-up is off and why. A green arrival is the only
  #     state a new row is signed onto.
  #   · A FAILED CHECK AFTER WRITING PUTS THE CLONE BACK: the ledger's arrival
  #     bytes and no path the pass created, from an EXIT trap, so a tick killed
  #     mid-pass restores too (TERM/INT/HUP become exits so the trap runs; only
  #     SIGKILL escapes it). Discarding is safe because every row this pass
  #     writes is re-derivable: `--append` recomputes from the mail and the
  #     welcome plan re-reads the ledger, so the household waits one tick.
  # A pass that changed nothing skips the second verify: the arrival check
  # already read these exact bytes, so the quiet tick costs one verify, as before.
  # The trap disarms the moment the commit lands; a push that then fails leaves
  # a local commit, exactly as it did before this block.
