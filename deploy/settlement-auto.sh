# settlement-auto.sh — the settlement's MECHANISM, box-side (Keemin-ruled
# 2026-08-17: settlements run like mail crossings — a timer on the box —
# while the Worldkeeper's heartbeats keep the JUDGMENT lane: blessing tags,
# holds, quarantine, refusal narratives, over whatever state this publishes).
#
# The shape mirrors the mechanical subset of the keeper's own chain
# (MEEPS/worldkeeper/memory/topics/the-settlement.md, steps 4-5-8):
#   fetch world main + every sketchbook to its exact remote tip · DRAIN the
#   journal into those sketchbooks and deliver them · derive the town stakes at
#   a pinned town read · run tools/settlement-sweep.mjs · run the world's HARM
#   GATE on the result (founder-ruled 2026-09-16: the crossing refuses only for
#   what it did to residents) · and only on no harm, push main (ff-only) plus
#   each rebased sketchbook under an explicit lease on the tip inspected · then
#   run the grammar suite as a CHECKER whose red is a warning, not a hold. No
#   lock is held: a door write landing mid-run makes a lease push FAIL SAFE
#   (exit 2 — rerun; the keeper's caught-race-restart, mechanized) instead of
#   making resident letters queue behind a long hold (the write-starvation
#   lesson, 2026-07-30).
#
#   A red suite publishes nothing and exits 1 loudly — a refusal is a
#   finding for the keeper's judgment, never a retry. NO TAGS from here:
#   settlement/S<N> blessing stays the Worldkeeper's pen, over the
#   already-public state (his S34/S36/S37 pattern).
#
# ── WHAT CHANGED 2026-08-27 (the drain night, founder-mandated) ──────────────
#
# Four defects, all four with receipts from the night of 08-26/27:
#
#   1. THE DRAIN HAD NO RUNNER. Since the 2026-08-24T19:39:13Z single-log
#      cutover every door write lands as a row in dynamic.db's journal, and
#      `office/src/world-drain.mjs` is what materializes those rows into the
#      `draft/<login>` sketchbooks this script then sweeps. Nothing called it.
#      A mark left at the door aged in the journal until a human ran the drain
#      by hand — Wright did, once, at 03:20Z on the 27th, and that is the only
#      time it had ever run. THE DRAIN IS NOW STEP ONE OF EVERY CROSSING, so a
#      door-written mark can never age past one crossing unattended.
#
#   2. THE RECEIPTS LIED BY OMISSION. The report said "N published" and the
#      sweep's commit said "N published, M unpublished". `left_drafted` (42
#      rows on the 26th), `quarantined` and `dropped` appeared on NEITHER — so
#      a starving crossing printed "0 published, 0 unpublished" and read as a
#      quiet day for two days. EVERY CHANNEL IS NAMED NOW, and the quiet pass
#      says what it surveyed rather than only that it found nothing.
#
#   3. A LOUD-EMPTY GUARD. A sweep that finds no candidates at all while
#      sketchbooks are holding escrow-backed deltas is not a quiet day, it is a
#      starving crossing, and it used to exit 0 green. The sweep now re-derives
#      that question by a different path and REFUSES with the reason.
#
#   4. ONE BAD MARK NO LONGER REFUSES THE WHOLE TOWN. On the 27th, ONE amend —
#      vermillion/the-pando-peak moved to at:(-95458,-95458), ~95km off-world —
#      turned eleven vessel/timetable tests red and refused EVERY household's
#      settlement, because the final suite gate is all-or-nothing. On suite red
#      the crossing now runs an ISOLATION PASS (tools/settlement-isolate.mjs):
#      it bisects the marks this crossing published, quarantines the offending
#      ones, SHOUTS the quarantine, and settles for everyone else. Only a red
#      it cannot attribute to a candidate still refuses the town.
#
# ── WHAT CHANGED 2026-09-08 (G1: the store becomes the only source) ──────────
#
# The fold's input used to arrive through two lossy hops. A door write landed in
# Postgres FIRST and was awaited (`src/world-journal.mjs:381-391`); the sqlite
# journal received a COPY afterwards; the drain emptied that copy into
# `draft/<login>` sketchbooks; and this script swept those branches. The five
# acts with no journal twin on 2026-09-06 are what a lossy hop looks like from
# outside: the fold could not see them because a copy failed, not because the
# store lacked them.
#
# SETTLEMENT_SOURCE=store removes both hops. The store is read directly, its
# marks are written down into LOCAL sketchbook branches in this disposable
# clone, and the sweep reads them exactly as it reads drained ones.
#
# THE FOLD IS NOT TOUCHED, AND EVERY GUARD ABOVE STAYS. The grammar that decides
# what publishes lives in the WORLD repo (`tools/settlement-sweep.mjs`,
# `tools/marks-fold.mjs`, `tools/settlement-isolate.mjs`) and is the world's law,
# not this box's. The store path hands that law the one input it already
# understands — local `refs/heads/draft/*` — so the loud-empty guard, the
# isolation pass, the race retry and the six-channel receipt all keep working on
# the same evidence they were written for.
#
# WHAT THE STORE PATH DROPS: the sketchbook fetch, the drain, the delivery push,
# and the end-of-run sketchbook lease pushes. WHAT IT KEEPS: the suite gate, the
# isolation pass, the retire step, the receipt, and main's own push lease with
# its cheap-salvage rebase — that lease is about WORLD MAIN and has nothing to do
# with sketchbooks, so it is untouched in both modes. The SKETCHBOOK leases go,
# and they go because there is nothing left to race: no store crossing pushes a
# draft branch, so no door write can invalidate one.
#
# ROLLBACK IS A FLIP, NOT A RESTORE. `SETTLEMENT_SOURCE=git` takes the original
# path, unchanged, for one crossing. It stays cheap only while the sketchbook
# branches are left standing on origin through the green week — deleting them
# with the swap would make the rollback a restore. They cost nothing; they are
# G2's line, not G1's.
#
# Env (unit): TOWN_CLONE, WORLD_CLONE (origin URL discovery only).
#   SETTLEMENT_SOURCE  `git` (THE DEFAULT) or `store`. A box that has not been
#                      told crosses exactly as it does today; the swap is armed by
#                      setting `store` in the unit's environment, deliberately, on
#                      the day it is ruled. It is a decision, not a default
#                      somebody discovers on the first tag that lands.
#   OFFICE_ROOT        the office checkout (default /srv/postmark-office)
#   SETTLEMENT_CLONE   the sweep's own clone (default $OFFICE_ROOT/settlement-clone)
#   SETTLEMENT_REPORT  the receipt path (default /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-auto.json)
#   SETTLEMENT_HISTORY the rolling receipt log (default beside the receipt, .jsonl)
#   SETTLEMENT_DRAIN   0 disables the drain step (the seam a falsifier pins)
#   SETTLEMENT_REGISTRY 0 disables the household registry refresh — the crossing
#                      then folds on whatever WORLD/households.json world main
#                      already carries, which is the pre-2026-09-09 behaviour and
#                      the seam this lane's falsifier flips. It lands on the
#                      receipt as `ran: false` with its reason, never as silence.
#   SETTLEMENT_ISOLATE 0 disables the isolation pass — a red suite refuses the town, as before
#   SETTLEMENT_RACE_ATTEMPTS  how many times a LOST RACE re-runs the whole crossing (default 3)
#   SETTLEMENT_ATTEMPT set by the retry wrapper on each child; never set it by hand
# Cwd: $OFFICE_ROOT. Exit: 0 published/quiet · 1 refused · 2 race.

#
# On 2026-09-14 window 188 closed at 05:45Z holding 29 locked claims its crossing
# refused to fold; the world test that refused it merged by 09:1x; two reruns at
# 13:21Z and 13:26Z then refused `clearing-did-not-run`, because the docket wait
# accepts only a window cleared at or after THIS crossing's own start and nothing
# would close until 17:45Z. A correct tree and an unfolded docket sat side by side
# for eight hours. Keemin's word that morning: *"we REALLY should not be
# constrained by OUR OWN rules from being able to quickly push fixes as needed."*
#
# So the operator gets a SECOND DOOR and the timer's guard is untouched. With
# this set, the docket read takes the newest CLOSED window that still holds a
# locked claim with no materialized mark — a fact about the store with no clock
# in it — and refuses `nothing-unfolded` when the world already carries
# everything. See the tool's header for why this cannot be reached by relaxing
# the wait instead.
#
# IT IS NEVER THE UNIT'S DEFAULT AND NEVER THE TIMER'S. `postmark-settlement.service`
# does not set it; `postmark-settlement-by-hand.service` does, carries no timer,
# and is started by a person — so the journal names the act by its own unit, and

# never be read back as a scheduled one.

# ── THE RACE RETRY (v1 #7, 2026-08-30) ───────────────────────────────────────
#
# Three sites in this script exit 2 for a lost race — a lease refused delivering
# the drain, main moved underneath the sweep, a sketchbook lease refused at the
# end — and the receipt each one writes says "rerun". Nothing reran. On
# 2026-08-30T17:54:23Z `draft/foundoutanyway` took a door write mid-sweep, the
# push was rejected `(stale info)`, the unit exited 2, and the crossing's whole
# 18 minutes of work sat unpublished until the next timer mark nine hours later.
# An instruction the receipt gives and nothing carries out is not a mechanism.
#
# A race is transient BY DEFINITION: it means someone else wrote while we looked.
# So the retry is the whole sweep from FRESH INPUTS — never a resume of a
# half-done run, because the inputs that lost the race are exactly the ones that
# must not be reused. Three attempts total; a race that survives all three is a
# real exit 2 whose message says so, and that one goes to the operator queue.
#
# It re-execs THIS script, so every attempt is a clean process with a clean temp
# dir and its own fetch. The retries stay inside the one unit invocation — same
# ExecStart, same systemd job, so nothing about the unit's serialization changes
# and a concurrent crossing is still impossible.
#
# The loop itself lives in deploy/settlement-retry.sh, and it lives there for one
# reason: a loop inlined here can only be exercised by a real lost race on a real
# box, which is to say never. As its own tiny script it is a falsifier's first
# argument (test/settlement-retry.test.mjs drives it with commands that exit 2,
# then 0, then 2 forever). What stays HERE is the part that needs this script's

# Immutable inputs: the town at a pinned sha.

# `stamp_projection` is looked up by — `(town_sha, handle)`, `world2/schema/
# 001_tables.sql:136-143`.

# THE FROZEN SNAPSHOT IS NO LONGER GIT-MODE ONLY (2026-09-09). It had exactly one
# reader, `tools/world-stake.mjs`, which the store path replaces — so the
# checkout was skipped under `store`. The household registry refresh below is its
# SECOND reader and it runs in both modes, so the snapshot is taken in both.
#
# AND IT MUST BE THE SNAPSHOT, NEVER `$TOWN` ITSELF. This script only FETCHES the
# long-lived town clone; nothing here advances its working tree, so the files on
# disk there are whatever some other hand's last checkout left. Measured rather
# than feared: on 2026-09-09 that tree sat at `5fa468e9` while its own
# `origin/main` was `4c234d47`. A registry derived from those files and stamped
# with `$TOWN_SHA` would name a tree its values did not come from, which is the
# one failure a freshness stamp exists to make impossible. So the export reads
# `$WORK/town`, and `deploy/settlement-registry.mjs` REFUSES unless the stamp

#                                                        (founder, 2026-09-09)
#
# `WORLD/households.json` is the World's ONLY knowledge of which handles form one
# household. It is an EXPORT of this office's resolver, and until this step it was
# written into the world BY HAND: the export tool's own header ruled that the
# refresh "belongs with pin churn, not on a timer" and is "the caller's act
# (founder hand or the keeper's crossing sweep)".
#
# Nobody was that caller after 2026-08-07. Thirty-three days later the committed
# file named 101 handles in 73 households while the town's own resolver named 157
# in 108, and every household that had joined in between was a stranger to the
# fold. The founder, reading the count: "How do we determine n households? How
# can that go stale? That seems very wrong."
#
# THREE READERS TAKE THIS FILE AS LIVE, AND THE THIRD FAILS SILENTLY:
#   · tools/marks-fold.mjs § parcel admissibility — the claim cap, sovereignty,
#     rivalry, consent. Takes `--households <file>`; the crossing passes none.
#   · tools/mark-lint.mjs § the consent gate — "your own household's ground".
#     Takes `--households <file>`; the crossing passes none.
#   · tools/settlement-sweep.mjs + tools/lane-wall.mjs — the AUTHORSHIP WALL.
#     Takes NO flag at all, and the sweep leaves a sketchbook it cannot bind
#     ALONE rather than refusing it. So a registry that does not know a household
#     produces a crossing that looks clean and verified nobody.
#
# A value nothing refreshes, read as live. SO THE CROSSING IS THE CALLER — here,
# at the top, in BOTH modes, BEFORE the fold reads it. Under `store` the same step
# runs and for the same reasons: the store's `identities`/`town_roll` do not yet
# feed the wall or the lint, so this file is still what both of them read.
#
# IT REFUSES RATHER THAN FOLD ON A REGISTRY IT CANNOT VOUCH FOR, exactly as the
# drain does. Folding under an unattributable registry is a WRONG publication —
# marks filed into the wrong households, a wall standing down — and it is silent.
# A refused crossing is a finding somebody reads. `SETTLEMENT_REGISTRY=0` is the
# deliberate bypass for an operator whose export is broken and who needs the town
# to cross anyway; it lands on the receipt as `ran: false` with its reason.
#
# THE COMMIT IS ITS OWN, AND THAT IS NOT A PREFERENCE. It would ride the sweep's
# `settlement: sweep …` commit if it could — that is where the crossing's other
# derived files land. It cannot: `settlement-sweep.mjs` REFUSES on a dirty
# checkout (its `clean-check` phase) and its commit stages an explicit path list
# this file is not on. A registry written into the clone and left uncommitted
# would refuse the crossing before the fold ever ran. Putting it on the sweep's
# list is a WORLD-repo change, and this office chain must not depend on a world
# change that has not landed — so the refresh commits itself, ahead of the fold,
# and world main carries the two commits in the order they actually happened.

# ── THE SKETCHBOOK SYNC IS FAST-FORWARD-AWARE (2026-08-27) ───────────────────
#
# This used to be `git branch -qf "$b" "$sha"` unconditionally: every local
# sketchbook was slammed back to its remote tip at the start of every run. That
# was safe while nothing ever WROTE to this clone. The drain writes to it, and
# the drain's one irreversible step — the journal truncate — happens INSIDE the
# drain, before this script can deliver what it wrote. So if a delivery ever
# fails, the drained commits live only as local refs here, and an unconditional
# reset on the next run would destroy the one copy of work whose journal rows
# are already gone. Undelivered work is now KEPT and retried instead:
#
#   local absent, or local is an ancestor of remote  → take remote (a fast-forward)
#   local is AHEAD of remote                          → KEEP local (undelivered drain)
#   diverged                                          → take remote, and shout
#
# The lease recorded in "$WORK/tips" is still the REMOTE tip in every case, so
# the compare-and-swap on the push below is unchanged: it still asks "has origin
# moved since I looked", which is the only question a lease should ask.
# ── THE ROLLBACK'S GHOST (repair 1, reviewer at f2274e47) ────────────────────
#
# THE DEFECT, and it points the dangerous way. The store path deletes every
# draft ref before it writes (`store-writedown.mjs § clearGitSketchbooks`). The
# git path deleted NOTHING: `$WORK/tips` is built only from
# `refs/remotes/origin/draft/*`, the sync loop below reconciles only the names it
# found there, and the sweep's `draftBranches` returns EVERY LOCAL draft ref. So
# the sketchbooks a store crossing left in this long-lived clone — minus the ones
# whose names collide with an origin branch and get reset — were folded by the
# next rollback crossing, carrying store renders under a receipt saying
# `source: git`. Sized by the reviewer against S63: 27 names collide and reset,
# **57 survive and are folded**.
#
# And the rollback is the hatch you reach for WHEN THE STORE PATH HAS ALREADY
# GONE WRONG, which is exactly the moment its leftovers are worst. The shape is
# new with G1: before it, a local-only sketchbook was delivered to origin
# immediately, so it never persisted.
#
# THE REPAIR IS NOT "DELETE EVERY TWIN-LESS LOCAL", and that matters. The git
# path deliberately KEEPS a twin-less local: a household drained for the first
# time whose delivery push failed has its only copy there, with its journal rows
# already truncated (`:339-345` pushes them, and says "it will be retried next
# crossing"). Deleting those would destroy the one copy of work the drain has
# already made irreversible — the exact defect the sync loop below exists to
# prevent, re-introduced by its own fix.
#
# So the two are told apart by the one fact that distinguishes them, which is the
# commit each write-down wrote:
#
#   subject begins `store write-down:`  → a store crossing's leftover, DELETE
#   tree equals main's tree             → carries nothing at all, DELETE
#   anything else                       → KEEP, and say why, and let the
#                                         delivery loop retry it
#
# The unrecognised case is KEPT, which is the conservative direction: a ref this
# cannot classify is treated as somebody's undelivered work, not as debris.

  #
  # WHAT IS ACTUALLY DARK, MEASURED 2026-09-22 on world `origin/main` at
  # `17fa4195`. `STATE/log` holds two families and only one of them is alive:
  #
  #   `<c>.journal.jsonl`  the DRAIN's act journal. Last written 2026-09-11
  #                        05:45:06Z (`4d491498`). The store path runs no drain,
  #                        so the swap already turned this off — ELEVEN DAYS
  #                        AGO. G1 is not the threat to it; G1 is what happened.
  #
  #   `<N>.jsonl`          `tools/crossing-save.mjs`'s entity/event snapshot,
  #                        still committed at :02 after each ferry crossing
  #                        (`17fa4195`, "crossing-save 205"). A different file
  #                        with a different grammar. This step does not touch it
  #                        and does not retire it — that is G2.
  #
  # So this step RE-LIGHTS the act journal rather than keeping it alive, and it
  # is the same bytes the drain wrote: `world2/tools/state-log-write.mjs` renders
  # through `src/state-log-from-store.mjs` and writes through the drain's own
  # `writeJournalWindow`, never a second serializer.
  #
  # ── WHY IT STANDS HERE, BEFORE THE FOLD ────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Two reasons, and the second is the one that would bite.
  #
  #   1. It needs `$DOCKET_WINDOW` and nothing else. The clearing has already
  #      locked the window, so every act this window owns is in `acts` by this
  #      line; the fold's output is not an input to a photograph of what people
  #      did. Placing it after the fold would buy nothing and cost ordering.
  #
  #   2. `$WORLD_BASE` IS THE QUIET PASS'S BASELINE AND IT IS SET AT :463 —
  #      before the docket exists. It means "main after the NON-SWEEP commits,
  #      before the fold", which is what lets a crossing where the registry
  #      moved and nothing settled still report `quiet` (:1064-1068). A
  #      photograph is exactly such a commit, so it is taken here and
  #      `$WORLD_BASE` is advanced past it. Written after the fold instead, it
  #      would make `$WORLD_TO` differ from `$WORLD_BASE` on every crossing and
  #      a quiet town would report `published` with six zero channels — which is
  #      the answer `settlement-history.mjs --recurring` reads to decide whether
  #      this town has settled in three days. The starving crossing with better
  #      paperwork, again, from a new direction.
  #
  #      Both readers of `$WORLD_BASE` want it advanced: the harm gate's
  #      `--base` (:990) measures what THE SWEEP produced, and a STATE commit in
  #      the base is a STATE commit the gate correctly does not attribute to it.
  #
  # And the fold does not mind main moving under it: it reads AT `--world-sha
  # "$WORLD_FROM"` (`canon-register.mjs § canonRegisterAtSha`), which is the
  # repair :763-786 already carries for the registry refresh committing here.
  # This commit touches `STATE/log/` only — no `WORLD/marks`, nothing the fold
  # reads at all.
  #
  # ── THE WINDOW IS NOT THE CROSSING, AND THE TOOL KNOWS IT ──────────────────
  #
  # `$DOCKET_WINDOW` is the CANDLE window. `acts.crossing` is the FERRY clock.
  # Candle window 204 is [09-21 17:45Z, 09-22 05:45Z); ferry crossing 204 is
  # [09-22 00:00Z, 09-22 12:00Z). One window's acts land in TWO journal files
  # and neither is finished until the next settlement writes into it — which is
  # what `writeJournalWindow`'s merge-by-seq has always been for. The tool
  # resolves the window's own `opens_at`/`closes_at` from the `windows` row and
  # groups by each act's own crossing value; it never derives a boundary from a
  # clock. See `state-log-write.mjs § WINDOW_BOUNDARY`.
  #
  # ── THE DEFAULT IS `sqlite`, AND IT ONLY LOOKS ─────────────────────────────
  #
  # `STATE_LOG_SOURCE=sqlite` (THE DEFAULT) runs `--check`: it renders the
  # window from the register, compares against what is on disk, and writes the
  # verdict into the receipt. IT NEVER FAILS THE CROSSING. On prod today it will
  # report `absent` for every crossing, because nothing has written a
  # `.journal.jsonl` since 09-11 — that report IS the measurement, and how many
  # lines it would have written is the size of the hole.
  #
  # `STATE_LOG_SOURCE=store` runs `--write`: the files ride this crossing's own
  # push. The flip is Wright's, by hand, after three consecutive windows check
  # clean on prod — and a check cannot read clean until a write has happened, so
  # the honest order is: flip one window by hand, check the next three.
  #
  # `--last-drained` is the drain's last file (`182.2538`), so `MERGE_HAZARD`
  # refuses any crossing value the drain already photographed: the register's
  # seq is `acts.id`, a different numbering, and re-deriving a drain-era window
  # would merge a SECOND copy of every line rather than replacing them.

  # ── THE ORDERING: THE FOLD READS AFTER THE CLEARING'S INGEST ────────────────
  #
  # Lane 2's stakes come from `escrow_projection`, written by `stamp-ingest.mjs`
  # inside the clearing's own transaction (`world2/tools/clearing-job.mjs:60`
  # shells to it as the census first step). So the store's escrow is as-of the
  # sha the CLEARING ingested, and this crossing must read after that, not beside
  # it. `$TOWN_SHA` is passed as the INPUT TO A CHECK, not as the sha folded at:
  # the store answers at its own ingested head, and `fold-input-cli.mjs` refuses
  # if that head is not in this town's history and NAMES the distance when it is
  # merely behind. An ingest that has stopped running is otherwise
  # indistinguishable from a quiet town.

  # lines above — AND ITS HEAD MAY ALREADY HAVE MOVED PAST IT BY THIS LINE.
  #
  # AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT SAID THE TWO WERE EQUAL BY CONSTRUCTION,
  # AND THAT WAS WRONG, and the correction is left visible rather than swapped
  # out because the wrong sentence is the more tempting one to write. The registry
  # refresh at :386-395 COMMITS `WORLD/households.json` onto this clone whenever
  # the household mapping moved, before the fold runs — which is exactly what
  # :418-425 says two hundred lines below ("main may already be ahead of
  # origin/main at this line"). A register stamped `git rev-parse HEAD` would then
  # carry a sha one commit past `--world-sha`, the fold's equality check would
  # throw, and THE CROSSING WOULD PUBLISH NOTHING — intermittently, only on the
  # crossings that follow a household declaration.
  #
  # So the register is read AT `--world-sha` (`canon-register.mjs §
  # canonRegisterAtSha` materializes that commit's `WORLD/marks` and runs the
  # checkout's own loader over it). The equality is true by construction now, and
  # `foldDelta` keeps the check as the falsifier for the day something other than
  # the registry moves main before the fold. What is passed here is only the
  # clone that HOLDS the object; the sha decides what is read.
  #
  # WITH IT the fold carries every standing mark canon does not hold, beside its
  # own docket — the repair for a window cleared outside this script's timing
  # (2026-09-12: window 184 cleared by hand at 05:52Z, its two marks never folded

# ── PUBLISHING MAIN, IN ONE PLACE ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A function, because there are now TWO crossings that push main and they are not
# the same crossing: the ordinary one, where the sweep published, and the one
# where the sweep published nothing and the household registry moved. Both need
# the cheap salvage and the race exit; a second copy of this block is how one of
# them quietly loses the salvage a year from now.
#
# THE CHEAP SALVAGE (founder, 2026-08-22, after S45 lost its push to a resident
# walking through doors mid-sweep: "can we just push whatever slightly stale
# version actually passed the settlement?"). The sweep's result is not stale
# about anything it WRITES — the usual racer is a door pen appending ledger
# lines, files the sweep never touches. So on a rejected push: fetch, and if
# every raced-in change touches only paths DISJOINT from the sweep's own
# writes, rebase the finished sweep onto the moved main and push once more.
# Any path overlap, any rebase conflict, any second rejection — the full
# rerun, exactly as before. The suite is deliberately NOT rerun on this path:
# that is the founder's ruling (the 28-minute sweep losing to a 5-second
# ledger line, twice, is the worse outcome), and the disjointness check is
# what makes it sound.
#
# `exit` inside a shell function exits the script, which is what the race branch
# means; and `WORLD_TO` assigned inside it is the script's own variable, which is
# what the salvage branch means. Both are POSIX and both are load-bearing.

# crossing's own question. A registry refresh must never be able to answer it
# yes. So the test asks `$WORLD_BASE`: main AFTER the refresh and BEFORE the
# fold. A registry-only crossing stays `quiet`; it simply has something to push
# before it says so.

  # keeper's receipt drift apart. The git wording is unchanged to the byte.

# ── THE RETIRE STEP (G1 lane 1) ──────────────────────────────────────────────

# The store learns what the world let go. Until this step existed nothing in the
# live write path ever set `marks.status = 'retired'` — the column and its CHECK
# have been in 001_tables.sql since the first migration with no pen behind them,
# and the pre-cutover dump read 1,019 standing and 0 retired, ever. The store
# then held ground under neighbours the world had already released, and
# `standing-equality` reddened on the difference.
#
# AFTER THE PUSH, AND THAT PLACEMENT IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT. Canon
# has not let a mark go until main is actually on origin. Retiring before the
# push would mean a raced or rejected push leaves the store having retired marks
# the world still carries — the same disagreement as today, pointing the other
# way, and harder to see because the receipt would claim it was handled. Placed
# here, a race exits above and the store is untouched.
#
# NOT FATAL TO A PUBLISHED CROSSING, and this is a deliberate asymmetry rather
# than a swallowed error. The world is already published at this line; refusing
# now would leave a receipt saying `refused` over a crossing that in fact landed
# canon, which is a worse lie than a named gap. So a refusal is LOUD — it shouts,
# it lands in the receipt as `ran: false` with its reason, and the keeper reads a
# crossing whose retirement is owed — but it does not retract a real publication.
# The step is idempotent, so the next crossing picks up what this one missed.
