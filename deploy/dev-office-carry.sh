# dev-office-carry.sh — carry a branch ref of postmark-office onto the DEV office
# by hand, step for step what .github/workflows/release-train.yml does for a
# release tag on prod (the office's dispatch lane deploys tags only; walking a
# train on dev.postmark.town's office is a hand-carry — auto-memory
# `dev-office-train-is-a-hand-carry`). Kept in the office repo (deploy/, moved from Wright-HQ/tools on 2026-09-27) so it is never
# lost with a session scratchpad again (the 09-01 one was).
#
#   bash deploy/dev-office-carry.sh origin/train/2026-w40
#
# What it does, in the workflow's order:
#   1. git archive <ref> from Wright's office clone → /tmp/wright-stage on the box
#   2. release.json into the stage {tag: <ref>, sha, target: dev, run: hand-carry}
#   3. deploy/remote-deploy.sh (from the clone's origin/main) → the box; preflight
#   4. rsync stage → /srv/postmark-office-dev: root files without --delete (the
#      root is shared with the box's own state: .env, clones), repo-owned dirs
#      with --delete (telemetry, .github, .omc excluded — the workflow's list)
#   5. remote-deploy.sh apply: stamp check, deps if the lockfile moved, restart,
#      the /release probe that only the new code passes, /town answers
