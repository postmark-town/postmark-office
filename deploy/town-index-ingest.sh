#!/bin/bash
# town-index-ingest.sh — the town index's runner (POS-268): office.db's tables,
# kept in the store by world2/tools/town-index-ingest.mjs (the law_ingester pen).
#
# Each run: fetch the town, then for every crossing's seal between the index's
# head and origin/main, oldest first, check the seal out and ingest it with
# --snapshot (the law: a snapshot per clearing); then ingest origin/main itself as
# the delta. The tool never moves a checkout, so this script does, in a clone
# that belongs to this unit alone.
#
# ── ITS OWN CLONE, WITH HISTORY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# $WORLD2_LAB/ingest-clones/town-index, a full clone. Not world2-refresh-clone's
# `town` clone: that one is `--depth 1`, and a delta is `git log head..sha`.
# Not the office's TOWN_CLONE either: this never takes the office's town lock.
#
# ── THE SEED IS A HAND STEP ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# An index with no head exits 3 here and writes nothing. The seed (the one whole
# derivation) is run once by hand at install, as the runbook says:
#   node world2/tools/town-index-ingest.mjs --town-repo "$DIR" --sha "$(git -C "$DIR" rev-parse HEAD)" --seed
#
# Exit 0 ingested (or nothing new) · 1 the pen refused or failed (the reason is in
# $WORLD2_STATE_DIR/town-index.json) · 2 the lane could not run · 3 no head yet.
