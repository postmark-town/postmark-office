# office-tick.sh — the rehydrate tick, snapshot-under-lock / derive-outside shape.
#
# The lock protects exactly one thing: nobody reads the clones' working trees
# while they move. Only the pulls mutate the trees, so the lock covers the
# pulls plus a frozen snapshot of the town clone (git clone --local: hardlinked
# objects, full history — hydrate shells `git log`, so a bare archive won't do)
# and is released in seconds. The heavy derivation (hydrate + publish-windows)
# runs against the frozen snapshot and can take as long as the town has grown
# without a single resident write bouncing on the lock.
#
# Before this shape (2026-07-30), the whole chain ran inside flock: the hold
# grew with the town's entire history (~2 min measured) against 30-second
# write-path waits — every letter ever sent made every future write a little
# more likely to bounce. Pulse:
# wright-2026-07-30-office-tick-lock-starves-write-paths.
#
# THE TICK NO LONGER RESTARTS THE OFFICE (2026-08-11). It ends by WRITING files
# — office.db, world.db, the panes — and the office picks them up itself: it
# watches both stores and swaps its read handle in place. The last step here is
# therefore a receipt, not an act: poll the local door until it answers with the
# sha we just hydrated. Restarting the service is now only ever a code deploy,
# by hand. Before this, the restart WAS the reload, and it killed every live MCP
# session four times an hour.
#
# Env (from /etc/postmark-office.env via the unit): TOWN_CLONE, WORLD_CLONE.
# Optional: OFFICE_DOOR (default http://127.0.0.1:4380 — the unit's --port).

  # Idempotent (--append skips recorded lines; no-op is the normal case);

  # welcome-on-tick (2026-09-17): the welcome bundle (founder-ruled 09-14) is
  # ✦5 to every household once, at its first resident. It is NOT derived from
  # the mail, so `--append` above does not and cannot write it — the town's own
  # registry row, its grammar note and its `--welcome` header all say "the
  # office writes the bundle at a crossing", and until this line nothing did.
  # Measured on the train tip: 6 households admitted after the 09-14 by-hand
  # pass held no bundle and no scheduled thing would ever have paid them.
  #
  # ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is the town's refusals that fix it: `--welcome`
  # declines onto an unsettled tail ("run --append first") and declines a date
  # before the ledger's last. So it runs AFTER the mint pass and BEFORE verify,
  # inside this same flock, with the same key — its rows are verified and pushed
  # by the commit already below rather than sitting unsealed until the next tick.
  #
  # It mints only households the town's own `--welcome-plan` names, and the
  # town's once-per-household law refuses a second bundle on its own.
  #
  # ⚑ ITS EXIT IS SWALLOWED ON PURPOSE, and the first draft of this line got it
  # wrong. Chained with `&&`, one refused bundle would have stopped `stamp-verify`
  # and the commit below — stranding the `--append` rows that DID land, unsealed
  # and unpushed, until a later tick. A refusal means one household waits one
  # crossing; it must never hold the mint pass hostage. Bad rows are still caught:
  # anything this writes goes through the verify on the next line.
