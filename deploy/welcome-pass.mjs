// welcome-pass.mjs — the office drain that pays the welcome bundle at a crossing.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: A PROMISE WITH NO KEEPER ──────────────────────────
//
// The welcome bundle is founder-ruled (2026-09-14): every household, once, at
// its first resident, ✦5 for joining. The town shipped the law and both verbs
// (`stamp-mint.mjs --welcome-plan` / `--welcome`) and the 112 standing
// households were minted BY HAND the same day. Three surfaces then went to
// press saying the office does the rest:
//
//   • the town's registry row: "the office writes the bundle at a crossing;
//     joining is the whole of the doing" (quest-registry.json, `awaits`);
//   • the town's grammar note: "written by the office drain at a crossing"
//     (stamp-mint.mjs, above WELCOME_RE);
//   • the `--welcome` verb's own header: "The normal writer is the office drain
//     at a crossing; this verb is that ceremony exposed for the retroactive
//     pass and for repair, never a second law."
//
// There was no drain. MEASURED, not assumed, before this file was written: the
// crossing's mint pass is `stamp-mint.mjs --append`, and `--append` appends
// `walkLedger`'s owed lines — DERIVED mints, recomputed from the mail. A
// welcome is not derived; it is an in-place assertion, folded from the rows
// already recorded (`deriveTransfers`: `else if (c.kind === 'welcome') add(...)`)
// and never generated. `grep -rn -- "--welcome" ` over this whole repo returned
// NOTHING on the train tip: the office had no welcome code of any kind. So six
// households that joined after the by-hand pass were reading a registry row
// promising them a bundle no scheduled thing would ever write.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node deploy/welcome-pass.mjs --town <clone> --key <pem> [--date YYYY-MM-DD]
//   node deploy/welcome-pass.mjs --town <clone> --dry-run
//
// Reads the town's OWN plan (`--welcome-plan`, which writes nothing and needs no
// key) and runs the town's OWN `--welcome` verb once per owed household. This
// office decides NOTHING about who is owed, which resident receives, or what a
// bundle is worth: the roll, the meep exclusion, the first-resident tie-break
// (earliest `pinned` in tools/github-ids.json, ties alphabetical, unpinned last)
// and the ✦5 all live in the town and are read from it. A second copy of the
// first-resident rule here is precisely the drift `STANDING_FACT`'s bound
// falsifier exists to prevent, one door over.
//
// ── IDEMPOTENT IN TWO PLACES, AND THE OUTER ONE IS NOT THE GUARD ────────────
//
// The plan re-reads the sealed ledger every run, so a welcomed household simply
// is not in the owed list on the next tick. That is the ordinary path, and it is
// NOT what makes a second pass safe: the town's `--welcome` refuses on its own
// — "FATAL: household already holds its welcome bundle … once per household,
// ever" — resolving the payer's house the way the verifier resolves it, so a
// re-key cannot smuggle a second bundle past either. The falsifier drives the
// SECOND apply and asserts the refusal, because a guard proven only by the list
// upstream of it is a guard nothing has tested.
//
// ── THE PARSE IS BOUND, NOT TRUSTED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The plan is prose, and this reads it. A wording change in the town would
// otherwise leave this parser finding zero owed rows and reporting a cheerful
// "nothing owed" forever — the silent-failure shape that is worse than a crash.
// So `parseWelcomePlan` reads the plan's OWN count out of its header line and
// refuses when the rows it parsed do not match it. The town changing its words
// reds the suite and stops the pass; it never quietly empties it.
//
// ── ORDER, AND WHY IT IS NOT FREE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `--welcome` refuses onto an unsettled tail ("ledger is behind the mail … run
// --append first") and refuses a date before the ledger's last ("append-only,
// forward-dated"). So this runs AFTER the tick's `--append` and BEFORE
// `stamp-verify` + the commit, inside the same flock and with the same key, so
// the bundles it writes are verified and pushed by the pass already there.
//
// EXIT: 0 when every owed bundle was written (or none was owed), 1 when any
// refused — with each refusal named. The tick treats a non-zero as non-fatal and
// says so in the journal: a household waits one crossing, it does not lose a
// bundle, and the ledger is never left half-verified.
