# world2-rehearsal-copy.sh — THE STORE GETS A REHEARSAL COPY (POS-242 part 1).
#
#   world2-rehearsal-copy.sh [--target world2_rehearsal] [--source world2_dev]
#
# One command: a live pg_dump of prod's store, restored into a freshly created
# `world2_rehearsal` on the same cluster, owned by `rehearsal_runner` — a role
# that cannot connect to the source. It prints the row count of every table on
# both sides, read from ONE snapshot, and the copy's equality is the receipt.
#
# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `world2_dev` IS prod's Postgres (office AGENTS.md). Until this script, the
# only rehearsal of a store change was by hand — a dump into a database with
# `scratch` in its name — and it happened once. Migrations 018-026 and window
# 212's hand fix were rehearsed only inside rolled-back transactions or on the
# dev sandbox, which holds none of prod's marks. The 09-26 slug collision is
# the kind of failure a copy of the real rows catches and a sandbox does not.
# `world2/tools/rehearse.mjs` is what runs on the copy.
#
# ── THE NAME GUARD ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The target is DROPPED and re-created on every run. So a target whose name
# lacks `rehearsal` is refused before anything connects, and so is a target
# equal to the source. There is no flag that turns this off.
#
# ── WHO OWNS THE COPY, AND WHY THE PENS ARE MEMBERS AND NOT GRANTEES ────────
# The office's own code must run on the copy unchanged except for its URL, and
# "unchanged" includes WHO it runs as: the claims trigger passes the clearing
# only when `current_user = 'clearing_job'` (002_grants.sql, 007_private_
# drafts.sql), so a copy the clearing reaches as any other role refuses every
# transition. The copy therefore keeps prod's ACL (restored from the dump, and
# every later migration's own GRANTs), and the runner reaches each pen by
# `SET ROLE` — the connection option `-c role=<pen>`.
#
# `rehearsal_runner` holds the pens WITH INHERIT FALSE, SET TRUE. That pair is
# the whole design:
#   · SET TRUE lets a session on the copy become `clearing_job`, `law_ingester`,
#     `office_api`, `snapshot_reader`, `stance_reader`;
#   · INHERIT FALSE means none of their privileges count for rehearsal_runner
#     itself — including CONNECT on the source. `world2_dev`'s datacl grants
#     CONNECT to the owner and the four pens by name and to no PUBLIC, so a
#     rehearsal session cannot open the source at all. A tool that falls back
#     to a hard-coded `world2_dev` URL fails to CONNECT; it never writes prod.
#   · `world2_owner` is deliberately NOT among them. It owns the source, and a
#     role that can become the owner can `DROP DATABASE` from any database it
#     can reach. On the copy, rehearsal_runner IS the owner: it stands where
#     world2_owner stands on prod, and it applies migrations as itself — the
#     prod idiom (`SET ROLE world2_owner`, world2/tools/README.md § Applying a
#     migration) with the copy's own owner.
# No existing role's own rights change. PUBLIC's CONNECT and TEMP on the copy
# are revoked, so no pen can open the copy by its own login either: the only
# road in is rehearsal_runner's.
#
# ── ONE SNAPSHOT, SO EQUALITY MEANS SOMETHING ───────────────────────────────
# The office is live while this runs. Counting the source after the dump would
# report the town moving, not the copy's fidelity. So the source is counted
# inside a REPEATABLE READ transaction whose snapshot pg_dump is handed
# (`--snapshot`): both read the same instant, and any difference is a defect.
#
# Runs as meepo (or any user with `sudo -n -u postgres`). Everything that
# touches Postgres goes through `sudo -n -u postgres` over the local socket:
# no URL, no password on a command line, nothing sourced. The only secret this
# script makes is rehearsal_runner's password, minted on first run into
# $REHEARSAL_DIR/runner.pw (0600) and never printed.
#
# Exit: 0 the copy equals the source · 1 it does not (or a step failed) ·
# 2 refused before touching anything.
