# office-rehydrate.sh — rebuild the office's read indexes, office.db (the town)
# and the world graph snapshot in the store (the world at the newest blessing),
# and confirm the door picked the new office.db up. Nothing else: the pulls, the mint, the
# settlements row and the panes moved to deploy/office-keep.sh (POS-268,
# 2026-09-27), so this unit is exactly the part the sqlite retirement deletes.
#
# It MOVES nothing. It reads the clones office-keep.sh freshened two minutes
# earlier, taking the town lock only for the seconds a `git clone --local`
# snapshot needs (hydrate shells `git log`, so a bare archive won't do), and
# derives outside it however long the town's history makes that.
#
# THE TICK DOES NOT RESTART THE OFFICE (2026-08-11). It writes files and the
# office swaps its read handle in place; the last step is a receipt, not an act.
#
# Env (from /etc/postmark-office.env via the unit): TOWN_CLONE, WORLD_CLONE.
# And PG_LAW_INGESTER_PASSWORD (from /etc/postmark-world2-dev.env, read by
# systemd and handed in): the world graph's store write takes the law pen.
# Optional: OFFICE_DOOR (default http://127.0.0.1:4380 — the unit's --port).
# Cwd: /srv/postmark-office (the unit's WorkingDirectory).

# The world graph rides the same unit — AT THE NEWEST BLESSING, never main (Keemin,
# 2026-09-18, postmark#2934: "shouldn't the bless override the tick?" — yes).
# The crossing commits its candidate to main and office-keep.sh's fetch carries it
# in within fifteen minutes; the keeper's `settlement/S<n>` tag is his
# judgment on it, and a refused crossing is never tagged. `--ref blessed`
# resolves the newest tag peeled to its commit (src/world-branches.mjs §
# blessed — the same resolution the fold serves, so store and fold agree), and
# the store stamps `as_of_settlement` / `candidate_ahead` for the doors. The
# fetch in office-keep.sh is what carries a fresh tag in (a plain fetch re-follows an
# annotated tag whose commit is already local — measured 2026-09-17). Never
# HEAD — the pen parks this clone on draft branches, and a draft-stamped store
# can never be eligible. Non-fatal: the office.db rebuild is never held
# hostage, and a stale-but-good snapshot beats none. Interim until the read
# flip (POS-104) takes standing from the clearing's lock.
#
# THE STORE IS THE ONLY OUTPUT (POS-270 lane W 3b). world.db is retired: the
# office reads the world graph snapshot per settlement (037/038), which this
# hydration writes as the law pen (deploy/world2-lib.sh § w2_pgenv — sed-read,
# never sourced; bash, for the lib). A miss — the store refused or unreachable,
# or the credential unreadable — leaves the office on the snapshot it already
# has, and the journal says so loudly. Non-fatal either way.
