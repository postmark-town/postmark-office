// portfolio-reads.mjs — THE PORTFOLIO DOOR'S PORT. `/world2/my-marks` answers
// `GET /world/my-marks` out of `claims`, `marks`, `identities` and
// `escrow_projection` instead of out of two working trees.
//
// ── WHAT 1.0 DOES, AND OUT OF WHAT ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `src/world.mjs § worldMyMarks` composes four lists from three readers:
//
//   drafts/docket  `guardedDraftsForKey(WORLD_CLONE, key)` — the overlay. Its
//                  live half is ALREADY ported (`guard-reads.mjs §
//                  pgDraftsForKey`); its git half is a draft BRANCH in the
//                  world clone.
//   published      `publishedState(WORLD_CLONE).state.marks` — the folded
//                  `WORLD/world-state.json` at the clone's main ref.
//   backed         `worldPortfolioStakeSlice` → the town clone's
//                  `deriveWorldMarkWeights`, whose rows `escrow_projection`
//                  already stores (see `stake-reads.mjs` for the arithmetic).
//
// THE DECISIONS ARE NOT RE-EXPRESSED HERE. `backedRow` (src/world-stake.mjs) is
// exported and pure precisely so one definition serves both doors — "`yours` is
// a sentence the town says to a resident about their own work, and it was wrong
// for as long as it was computed off a record that had not been written yet." A
// second copy of that sentence in this file would be a copy of a law, and copies
// drift. Same for `markPage`: the page bound and its `withheld` naming are
// 1.0's, imported, so a bound and its count stay one change and never two.
//
// ── WHAT THE STORE CANNOT ANSWER, NAMED ─────────────────────────────────────
//
//   branch · main · draft
//       `world-branches.mjs § draftDeltaForKey` — a branch NAME and two git
//       SHAs (the clone's main ref, and the head of this household's
//       `draft/<household>` branch). They are facts about a checkout. The store
//       holds `projection_heads` for the LAW and the TOWN, and nothing at all
//       for a per-household draft branch.
//   published[].weight · published[].weight_parts
//       The fold's ✦ figure and `marks-fold.mjs § partsOf`'s receipt for it.
//       This is the THIRD quantity `world-stake.mjs` warns about in place: the
//       telling's weight "also includes everything sitting inside it fanning
//       up, which is the WORLD's tree and invisible from the ledger". The store
//       holds the ledger's positions, so it can answer `stamps` (raw own
//       escrow) exactly and cannot answer `weight` at all. Emitting the ledger
//       weight under the word `weight` would be the two-quantities-one-word
//       defect the 1.0 door exists to have stopped — so the fields are ABSENT
//       and named, never approximated.
//
// Everything else is byte-equal by construction: the same splitter, the same
// filters, the same sort, the same labels, the same pager.
