// conversations.mjs — THE TOWN'S SPEECH, served from `acts`.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `/world/conversations` is the page the town reads itself
// back from, and 1.0 serves it out of `voices-log.jsonl` — a box-local file,
// never git, never the ledger, backed up by nothing. It is the LAST read in the
// live tier still answering from a 1.0 pen, and at the cutover that file dies
// (anti-rebake rule 6). D4's read port is what has to be standing when it does.
//
// The record is already in the store. Every voice is also an emission
// (`emissionFromVoice`, "the second consumer of a voice"), every emission is
// crystallized into a crossing log, and the seed carried 1,630 of them into
// `acts`. Since 2026-08-28 the LIVE lane reaches `acts` directly too
// (world-journal.mjs § THE LANE HOOK: "a SAY … keeps its own pen, and this is
// the SECOND consumer of the same fact"). What was missing was the derivation.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT, against the prod office's own voices log:
//
//   1,630 emission acts · 1,630 log lines inside the acts era · 0 missing ·
//   0 extra · 0 field-drift rows. 823 log lines predate the acts era and 238
//   postdate it (the crossings after the store's floor).
//
// So the two records agree exactly where they overlap, and the falsifier
// (`falsifier-conversations-equality.mjs`) compares them era to era rather than
// whole — AB-P2's lesson, and E2's: "the store carrying more record than the
// frozen tag is the store being right."
//

//     `chains` / `clusterVoices` / `threadOf` — VENDORED verbatim. The thread
//     derivation is 1.0's law about its own speech ("a thread is a derivation,
//     not an object") and a re-expression would be a twin.
//   src/world-journal.mjs 70c5a1f8ee751062678c696aee40975fcf969cd7
//     `composeAnchor` — VENDORED. A live `say` act stores the witnessed line
//     (anchor + offset), never a bare x,y, so a reader has to compose it back.
//
// VENDORED RATHER THAN IMPORTED, and the reason is `voices.mjs`'s own module
// init: it reads the say dials off the 1.0 sqlite world store at IMPORT time
// (`SAY_DIALS = readSayDials()`). Importing it into this tier would put a 1.0
// store read in the boot path of a Postgres-only door — the coupling the whole
// read tier exists to end — and it dies at cutover regardless.
//
// ── THE DIALS COME FROM THE STORE, NOT FROM 1.0 ─────────────────────────────
//
// Every standing number of speech is law, and `the-town/say` says so in its own
// record: *"postmark-office src/voices.mjs — every standing number of speech
// reads off this node's dials; the module constants remain only as the fallback
// a store-less boot stands on, and say so."*
//
// In 2.0 those dials are `marks` rows: the say class's PREDICATE CHILDREN, each
// a predicated mark carrying `data.slot` and `data.value` under
// `data._parent_is_law = 'the-town/say'`. (`the-town/say`'s own `dials: {}` is
// empty — the migration `dialNumber` documents, "predicate children first,
// frontmatter second", already completed for this class.) So `sayDials` below
// asks Postgres, and this door needs no 1.0 store at all.
//
// EVERY DIAL SAYS WHETHER IT WAS READ, exactly as `SAY_DIALS` does, and for
// voices.mjs's own reason: "a silent fallback is indistinguishable from a good
// read, and that is exactly how every walker in the world moved at a quarter of
// the lawful stride for five days."
//
// ⚑ AND THE HONEST LIMIT OF THAT CHECK: on today's register all seven recorded
// values EQUAL voices.mjs's fallback constants (earshot 60, fade 5, lull 30,
// hear-max 20, presence 15, speak-every 15, text-max 500). So a bug in the dial
// SOURCE would be invisible in every comparison until one of them moves. The
// falsifier states this rather than reporting a green it did not earn.
