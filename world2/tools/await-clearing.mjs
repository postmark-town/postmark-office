//
// EXIT: 0 a docket is locked and named on stdout · 1 REFUSED with the reason as

//
// ── WHY THE ORDER INVERTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// In the git era the settlement and the candle were independent. The sweep
// committed at :45:32 and the clearing locked window 177's docket at :45:44 —
// the fold ran BEFORE the clearing and did not care, because its input came from
// sketchbook branches the drain had already written.
//
// After G1 the fold's input IS the clearing's output. The candle locks the
// closing window's docket; the fold then reads that docket as the crossing's
// delta. A crossing that folds before the clearing has locked is folding the
// previous window a second time, and it would look exactly like a quiet
// crossing: same marks, nothing new to publish, green.
//
// ── WHAT IT WAITS FOR, AND WHY THAT CONDITION AND NOT ANOTHER ───────────────
//
// A window whose `cleared_at` is at or after THIS CROSSING'S OWN START. Nothing
// timing-based, no grace window, no "recent enough".
//
// The tempting condition is "the most recently closed window", and it is wrong:
// on a crossing where the clearing has not run yet, that answers with the
// PREVIOUS crossing's docket and the wait returns instantly having waited for
// nothing. The second tempting condition is "the currently open window has
// closed", and it is wrong the other way: if the clearing already ran before
// this tool was reached, the open window is the NEXT one, and waiting for it to
// close waits for the next crossing — twelve hours.
//
// The crossing's own start instant separates them with no ambiguity, because the
// clearing for this crossing necessarily clears after the crossing began. That
// is the observed shape on the box (receipt `at: 17:45:00Z`, window 177
// `cleared_at 17:45:44Z`) and it is also the definition: a docket cleared before
// this crossing started belongs to an earlier one.
//
// ── AND IT REFUSES RATHER THAN PROCEEDING ───────────────────────────────────
//
// A timeout is a clearing that did not run, which is a candle that has stopped.
// Publishing the previous window's fold under a fresh receipt would be the
// 2026-08-26 starving crossing with better paperwork, so the refusal names the
// window it was waiting past and how long it waited.
//
// ── `--by-hand`: THE OPERATOR DOOR (postmark#2786, ruled 2026-09-14) ─────────
//
// The guard above is right for the timer and wrong for the operator whose
// PREVIOUS crossing published nothing. Measured: on 2026-09-14 window 188 closed
// at 05:45Z holding 29 locked claims that its refused crossing never folded; the
// world test that refused it was fixed and merged by 09:1x; two reruns at 13:21Z
// and 13:26Z then refused `clearing-did-not-run`, because no window had cleared
// at or after 13:21Z and none would until 17:45Z. A correct tree and an unfolded
// docket sat side by side for eight hours, and 29 residents' marks stayed
// locked-but-unpublished for a day. The paired recovery the record prescribed —
// the sweep first, the candle while it waits — answered "no window past its
// close, nothing due", because the open window 189 was not due until 17:45Z.
//
// So a rerun by hand is a SECOND DOOR, never a loosening of the first:
//
//   the timer asks   "which window closed for THIS crossing"        (an instant)
//   the operator asks "which closed window is still UNFOLDED"       (a state)
//
// The second question has no timing in it at all, so it cannot be answered by
// relaxing the first — a grace window, a "recent enough", a longer timeout would
// each have let the timer take a stale docket on the night the candle died,
// which is the whole class the wait exists to prevent. The by-hand read is
// instead the NOTARY'S OWN: a closed window holding at least one locked claim
// with no materialized mark (`canon-locks.mjs § UNMATERIALIZED_SELECT`, the read
// `falsifier-canon-locks.mjs` runs nightly). "Unfolded" is a fact about the
// store, true or false without reference to any clock, which is what makes it
// safe to hand an operator.
//
// It never takes the OPEN window: closing a window early is a different act with
// a different owner (`clearing-job.mjs --window N`, the candle's pen), and the
// issue's second path was ruled out of this door's scope.
//
// It never waits, because there is nothing to wait for — the question is already
// answered by the store's current state, and a poll loop would only re-ask it.
//
// And it is never the unit's own default. `deploy/postmark-settlement.service`
// does not set it; `deploy/postmark-settlement-by-hand.service` does, carries no
// timer, and is started by a person — so the journal names the act by its unit
// and the receipt carries `by_hand: true` beside it. A by-hand publication that
// could be mistaken for a scheduled one would be a worse record than no rerun.
//
// ── `--rehearse`: THE SHADOW'S QUESTION (2026-09-25) ─────────────────────────
//
// The settlement shadow runs at 10:23Z and 22:23Z, between crossings, so neither
// question above has an answer it can use: no window clears after its start, and
// on a healthy day nothing is unfolded. It asks a third one — "which window is
// the newest CLOSED one" — which is the only window `foldDelta` will fold at all
// (`not-newest-closed-window`). The shadow publishes nothing, so re-folding a
// published docket is its point: the write-down skips every mark canon already
// holds byte-for-byte, and what is left is what the next crossing would carry.
// Never a crossing's door — `settlement-auto.sh` does not pass it.
