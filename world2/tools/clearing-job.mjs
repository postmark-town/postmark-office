// clearing-job.mjs — THE CANDLE'S CLOSE. One transaction per window.
//
// LAW (gold §1, verbatim): "The clearing's transitions are the sweep's existing
// outcomes, renamed: published → locked (materialized) · unpublished/quarantined
// → refused with the failing check named (attributable by construction; the
// isolation pass dies) · dropped/the-already-standing → refused-duplicate ·
// withdrawn → retracted · left_drafted → stays pending · rebased → ceases to
// exist (git mechanics, not a decision)."
//
// LAW (census.md Decision 2, verbatim): "Competing claims on the same ground in
// one window: neither locks; both held for REVIEW (a mind rules). Stake-weight
// is advisory context, never an auto-win."
//
// LAW (census.md seams amendment): stamp ingest runs "again as clearing_job's
// first step" at window close, then the window pins law_sha + town_sha —
// outcomes reproducible from (claims, law_sha, town_sha).
//
// LAW (Wright's ruling on the replay gate's finding 4, 2026-08-28 eve, verbatim):
// "tier is recomputed for ALL standing marks inside the clearing transaction,
// which is settlement-equivalent staleness, zero new class" — the cadence being
// 1.0's own, "derived weight moves at the next Settlement" (ECONOMY-DIALS
// read_side). That is step 7, the window's last act; the walk lives in
// standing.mjs and `falsifier-standing-equality.mjs` holds it to 1.0's fold.
//
// PEN: connects as clearing_job — the ONLY role transitioning claims,
// writing windows, and materializing marks (gold §3 rule 2). The stamp ingest
// first-step runs as law_ingester (its own pen) BEFORE this transaction; this
// tool shells to stamp-ingest.mjs for it rather than borrowing its grants.
//
// LAW (Keemin, postmark#2594, ruled 2026-09-08 and RE-RULED the same evening on
// the reviewer's measurement): the canon-absent check is NOT at this lock step.
// The crossing's own settlement pushes its mark files to origin three to four
// minutes AFTER this job clears the window — seven consecutive crossings
// measured, never once before — so a canon check here refuses the marks its own
// crossing just locked. It lives on the nightly read instead
// (`falsifier-canon-locks.mjs`, the notary rail) and becomes structurally
// impossible at the G1 swap. What DOES belong here is step 5.5: the escrow
// PRESENCE rule, which reads the town and races nothing.
//
// Usage (box):
//   node world2/tools/clearing-job.mjs --window <N> \
//     [--town-repo <checkout>]        # when given: stamp-ingest first (the census first-step)
//     [--dry-run]                     # compute + print transitions, commit nothing
//   env: WORLD2_CLEARING_URL = postgres://clearing_job:...@localhost/world2_dev
//        WORLD2_INGEST_URL   = postgres://law_ingester:... (only with --town-repo)
//
// The next window opens in the same transaction (id N+1, 12h span) — the candle
// never leaves the town without an open window.

  //     the cap counts per credential household, hers resolves to the founder's,

  //     Two gates, two answers. The candle admitted what the sweep would refuse

  //
  //     RULING (Wright, 2026-08-28 eve, on the replay gate's finding 4):
  //     "tier = recompute-at-close, per the dials' own cadence ('derived weight
  //      moves at the next Settlement'); the standing walk ports as a spatial
  //      query; the replay gate is the judge."
  //
  //     The finding it closes: "`data.tier` is not a field of the record — it is
  //     what the fold says after resolving the whole world, and 1.0 recomputes it
  //     for all 960 records at every settlement. 2.0 writes it once, at
  //     materialization, and never revisits it."
  //
  //     ALL STANDING MARKS, not this window's. That is the whole point: standing
  //     is a fact about the ground a mark stands on, so a NEIGHBOUR's parcel
  //     landing in this window moves marks nobody claimed —
  //     `berthillon/le-petit-berthillon` went `market → home` with every authored
  //     byte identical, because `berthillon/chez-antoine` gave the walk sovereign
  //     ground to stop at.
  //
  //     INSIDE THIS TRANSACTION, because a recompute that could land after the
  //     window closed would be a second pen writing the register, and the
  //     determinism property ("every window's outcome is reproducible from
  //     (claims, law_sha, town_sha)") would stop being true of `marks`.
  //
  //     ONLY THE ROWS THAT MOVED are written, and the count is a receipt: a
  //     recompute that touched every row every window would tell a reader nothing
  //     about whether the world moved.
  //
  //     The walk itself is `materialize.mjs`'s, shared with the REVIEW lane for
  //     the same reason step 6 is: a ruling that grants ground has to move the
  //     neighbours' standing exactly as a clearing does.
