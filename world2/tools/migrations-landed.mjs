// migrations-landed.mjs — WHICH MIGRATIONS A STORE HAS, READ FROM THE SCHEMA.
//
// There is no migrations table in this store (world2/tools/README.md § Applying
// a migration to a live store): every `world2/schema/*.sql` past the floor is
// hand-applied, and each file's own header says how to prove it landed. This is
// those proofs, one boolean query per file, so a tool can ask a store "which of
// these have you got" without anyone having written the answer down.
//
// Measured 2026-09-26 on prod (`world2_dev`), read-only: 001-018 true, 019-026
// false — the w40 train's migrations are the ones prod lacks.
//
// EVERY FILE HAS AN ENTRY, and `test/world2-rehearsal-guards.test.mjs` holds
// that: a new migration without a probe fails the suite, because a runner that
// cannot tell whether a migration landed would either re-apply it (014 is not
// idempotent) or skip it silently.
//
// An entry is one of:
//   { probe: "<SELECT returning one boolean>" }  — true = landed
//   { skip: "<why this file is not applied>" }    — 003 (a falsifier query, not a
//                                                   migration — the CI floor skips it
//                                                   for the same reason) and 022
//                                                   (the file does nothing)
//
// A probe asks for the LAST thing its file does where that is cheap, so a
// migration that half-landed outside its own transaction reads as not landed.
// 017 is a DATA migration and its probe is a data question: a row written with
// an object-shaped `source` after 017 ran would read as "017 missing" and the
// runner would re-apply it — which is safe, because 017's own statements are
// guarded UPDATEs (017's header), and is also the correct repair.
