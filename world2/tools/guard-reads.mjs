// guard-reads.mjs — the WRITE PATH's own validation inputs, ported to Postgres.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (DESIGN-pen-flip.md § 2, R3 — quoted verbatim):
//
//   "A pen flip without a read flip produces an office that writes to Postgres
//    and validates against sqlite — a split brain with a switch on it. Every
//    door guard below reads a 1.0 pen today"
//
//   | read | source today | who needs it |
//   |---|---|---|
//   | `liveMarks` / `liveChildrenOf` | `journal` | leave-mark slug collision, parcel cap, withdraw's stranding check |
//   | `draftsForKey`                 | `journal` + git sketchbook | the signed-in draft overlay |
//   | `liveHolder` / `readAttachments` | `attachments` | give/drop/take's holder check |
//
//   "Not yet ported: the mark door guards (row 1–2) … and the holder check
//    (row 6). Those are the write path's own validation inputs, so they gate
//    the write flip specifically."
//
// This file is those three rows. The sibling lane `postgres-world/live` did the
// LIVE read tier the same way (`live-reads.mjs`), and this is deliberately its
// twin in shape: a PORT of 1.0's own law as pure functions over DB-shaped rows,
// held to the original by a falsifier that runs BOTH over the same state
// (`falsifier-guard-equality.mjs`).
//
// ── PURE OVER ROWS AND A CLIENT. NOTHING FROM `src/` IS IMPORTED ─────────────
//
// live-reads.mjs's reason was that the read tier holds no world checkout. This
// file's reason is different and worth stating, because a reader who knows the
// first reason will ask why it applies here — the write path DOES run inside
// the office, and it CAN import.
//
// It does not import for two reasons:
//
//   1. `src/world-journal.mjs` imports `world2-acts.mjs`, `world2-claims.mjs`
//      and `world2-pen.mjs`; `src/world-hold.mjs` imports `dynamic-store.mjs`
//      (and with it `node:sqlite`). A guard read that pulled the whole 1.0 pen
//      in behind it would make "2.0 validates from 2.0" false at the import
//      line — the flip's own dependency, arriving through the back door.
//   2. This is the READ half of a flip whose write half is being built beside
//      it. A module with no office dependencies can be wired into the door, or
//      into `world2-serve.mjs`'s read tier, or driven by a falsifier holding
//      only a connection string, without any of the three pulling the others.
//
// So: where a predicate is SMALL AND EXACT it is VENDORED verbatim with its blob
// sha (live-reads.mjs's rule, unchanged). Where it is a whole module's judgment —
// `replayDrafts`, `pathFor` — it is REFUSED and taken as an INJECTED PARAMETER,
// so the office hands over its own function rather than this file growing a twin
// of it. `falsifier-guard-equality.mjs` injects 1.0's real ones, which is what
// makes the equality total rather than scoped around the hard part.
//
// ── WHAT ANSWERS EACH READ IN 2.0, AND WHY ──────────────────────────────────
//
// | 1.0 read | 1.0 store | 2.0 store | the mapping's own argument |
// |---|---|---|---|
// | `liveMarks` | `journal` rows, class `mark`, latest-wins | `claims` where status ∈ (draft, pending) | a claim IS a live declaration; it leaves the live layer exactly when the candle rules on it |
// | `liveChildrenOf` | the same, filtered on `parent_id` | the same, `data->>'parent_id'` | `parent_id` rides `claims.data` (the docket pen's `...rest` spill) |
// | `draftsForKey` (journal half) | `replayDrafts` over the log | `claims` + the withdraw acts | § THE DELETED ARM below — it is NOT in `claims`, and that is a finding |
// | `liveHolder` | `attachments` | `acts`, folded | § HOLDING, two eras |
//
// THE SUPERSESSION FOLD IS ALREADY APPLIED IN 2.0, and that is the single
// biggest structural difference. 1.0's `liveMarks` folds a LOG — "latest-wins,
// in seq order — the log's own order is the supersession order" — because the
// journal holds every declaration ever made about a slug. `claims` holds ONE ROW
// PER SLUG PER HOUSEHOLD: the docket pen rewrites the draft in place
// (world2-claims.mjs § the stake crossing the boundary, "the act does not create
// a second claim -- it rewrites the one they composed"). So the fold this file
// performs is not latest-wins; it is a SELECT, and the equality falsifier's job
// is to prove the pen's in-place rewrite reaches the same answer the log's fold
// does. Those are two different claims and only the second is testable here.
//
// ── WHAT IS **NOT** HERE, AND WHY (the honest list) ─────────────────────────
//
//  1. THE GIT SKETCHBOOK HALF of `draftsForKey`. 1.0 unions the journal replay
//     with `draftDeltaForKey` — the `draft/<household>` branch, "still holding
//     every draft written BEFORE the flag flipped". That branch has no 2.0
//     surface and never will: Phase 5.6 moved private drafts into `claims`
//     precisely because "a draft/<household> branch in a public repo was always
//     readable". `DISCLOSURES.sketchbook` is what the door says instead.
//  2. `path`. 1.0's filing comes from `pathFor` + the frozen filing manifest, and
//     2.0 has no filing at all — the notary exports acts, not a mark tree. `path`
//     is therefore an INJECTED resolver, `null` when the caller supplies none,
//     and never guessed. See `DISCLOSURES.filing`.
//  3. CANON. Every guard reads canon-plus-overlay (`journalLeaveMark`:
//     "It runs over canon-plus-overlay like every other guard in this function").
//     Canon in 2.0 is the `marks` table, and reading it is one plain SELECT that
//     needs no port. `publishedIdsFrom` is the one convenience here; the guards
//     take canon as an argument the way `canonForGuards()` hands it over today.
//  4. THE PARCEL CAP'S OWN ARITHMETIC and the sovereignty check. Both read canon
//     + the live layer and then do town-law math (`PARCEL_CLAIM_CAP`,
//     `marksContain`, the households registry). The law is `law_projection`'s and
//     the geometry is the fold's; neither belongs to a store read. This file
//     supplies the LIVE HALF of that guard's input and stops there.

// THE LIVE LAYER — `claims` as 1.0's live marks
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// ── WHICH STATUSES ARE "LIVE", AND THE ONE THAT IS UNRULED ──────────────────
//
// 1.0's live layer is "everything it has declared since the last save that has
// not been withdrawn". Its boundary is THE DRAIN: the journal truncates at the
// crossing-save, so a declaration leaves the live layer when the settlement
// takes it. 2.0's boundary is the CANDLE, and the two agree on four of the six
// statuses without argument:
//
//   draft        live   — composed, unstaked, private. 1.0's unsaved sketch.
//   pending      live   — on the docket, not yet ruled on. 1.0's unsaved sketch
//                         with a stake behind it.
//   locked       gone   — it is a row in `marks` now, which is canon. 1.0's
//                         drain moved it to the sketchbook/main the same way.
//   refused      gone   — the candle ruled against it.
//   retracted    gone   — the author let it go (2.0's withdraw-of-a-pending).
//   held_review  ⚠ UNRULED — see below.
//
// `held_review` is census decision 2 ("colliding claims -> held_review, a mind
// rules"). It has NO 1.0 counterpart: in 1.0 a colliding declaration sits in the
// journal until the settlement adjudicates it, so it IS live. In 2.0 it has left
// `pending`, so by the rule above it is not.
//
// EXCLUDED, and tripwired rather than assumed. The reasoning both ways is real —
// including it is safer for the slug-collision guard (a guard that misses a live
// mark lets a duplicate through) and wrong for the parcel cap (it would count a
// claim the town has not granted) — and picking between them is a ruling, not a
// port. There are ZERO held_review rows on `world2_dev` today (measured
// 2026-08-28), so the choice costs nothing yet; `admissionNotes` fires the day
// it does, which is the day somebody has to rule.

 * quotes and which is if anything sharper on a GUARD: a guard read that silently
 * drops a row does not answer wrongly, it PERMITS wrongly, and the symptom is a
 * duplicate slug or a fourth parcel rather than a bad number on a page.
 *
 * ── THE FIELD MAP, AND ITS THREE SEAMS ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `submitClaimFromJournal` takes the journal payload apart like this:
 *
 *   const { slug: _s, at, extent, points, body, stamps, put_forward, ...rest } = payload;
 *   const geometry = placed ? { slug, at, extent, ...(points ? { points } : {}) } : { slug };
 *   const data = JSON.stringify({ ...rest, _journal_seq: seq, … });
 *
 * so the record is reassembled from four columns and a spill. Three fields do
 * NOT come back the way they went in, and each is handled by NAME here rather
 * than by widening a comparison later:
 *
 *   `stamps`      → `claims.stake`. The door's `stamps:` is the claim's stake.
 *                   Reconstructed only when the column is non-zero, because 1.0
 *                   carries no `stamps` key at all on an unstaked declaration
 *                   and inventing `stamps: 0` would make every draft differ.
 *   `put_forward` → `status`. It is "the DOOR's verdict, not the caller's word",
 *                   and the status IS that verdict recorded. Reconstructed as
 *                   `true` on a pending row; NOT reconstructed as `false` on a
 *                   draft, for the same absent-vs-false reason, and because a
 *                   draft promoted later by `world_stake` never had the field.
 *   `household`   → the RESOLVED KEY (`gh:…` / `solo:…`), not the journal's own
 *                   `household` field. THIS IS live-reads.mjs's `_cred` EDGE, one
 *                   table over, and it bites harder here: 1.0's guards compare
 *                   `m.household` against a household NAME. The journal's
 *                   spelling is kept under `_journal_household` when the row
 *                   carries one, and `household` holds what the column holds,
 *                   under its own name, so nothing can confuse the two silently.

// THE DRAFT OVERLAY — `draftsForKey`'s journal half, over `claims` + `acts`
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// ── THE DELETED ARM IS NOT IN `claims`, AND THAT IS THE FINDING ─────────────
//
// `replayDrafts` produces three statuses, and only two of them have a `claims`
// source:
//
//   added      a live declaration canon does not hold      → a live claim
//   modified   a live declaration canon DOES hold          → a live claim
//   deleted    a WITHDRAWAL of a mark canon holds          → nothing at all
//
// The third one is worth reading twice. `submitClaimFromJournal`'s withdraw arm
// has two outcomes — DELETE a draft, UPDATE a pending row to `retracted` — and
// its own comment rules on the third case:
//
//   "rowCount 0 is lawful: withdrawing a PUBLISHED 1.0 mark has no pending
//    claim to retract — that lane is the settlement unpublish, not the docket."
//
// Lawful for the DOCKET and fatal for this read. 1.0's overlay draws the mark
// the household is proposing to remove ("Without these two the journal would
// hand the viewer an empty grey rectangle where the git path hands it the mark
// the resident is removing"), and after a published-mark withdrawal `claims`
// holds no row of any status to draw it from.
//
// It is not lost — the withdraw ACT mirrors (world-journal.mjs's deferral is
// narrow: "ONLY an unstaked mark-class declaration defers … withdrawals of
// public marks … mirror exactly as before"). So the deleted arm's source is
// `acts`, and this port reads it there.
//
// ── AND ITS SCOPE, WHICH `acts` DOES NOT SUPPLY ────────────────────────────
//
// The journal TRUNCATES at every drain; `acts` is append-only and truncates
// never. So "every withdraw act" is every withdrawal since the seed, and an
// overlay built from it would keep showing a mark deleted three settlements ago.
//
// The scope is the mark's own life, not the log's: a withdrawal is live exactly
// while the mark it withdraws still STANDS in `marks`. Once the settlement
// retires it, canon agrees with the household and there is nothing left to
// propose. That is self-limiting, needs no cursor, and matches 1.0's `if
// (!published) continue` on the other side of the same branch.
//
// ── AND THE HOUSEHOLD IT IS SCOPED BY, WHICH IS NOT `acts.household` ────────
//
// FOUND BY THIS LANE'S FALSIFIER, 2026-08-28, and it is a defect in the store
// rather than in this read: `acts.household` and `claims.household` carry the
// SAME FACT IN TWO SPELLINGS.
//
//   acts.household     'darko'  ×12  — every live-written act; NULL on all 2925
//                                      seeded ones (STATE/log states none)
//   claims.household   'gh:67605380', 'solo:the-town', … — the RESOLVED KEY,
//                                      per Wright's 2026-08-28 ruling
//
// The docket pen was corrected to the key ("adopt 1.0's spelling … a roster
// owner keeps the household KEY") and the acts mirror was not — `mirrorAct`
// writes `row.household` verbatim, and `row.household` is
// `resolvedWorldHousehold(key)`, which is the office key's NAME. So an overlay
// that filtered `claims` by the key and `acts` by the same string would return
// the added/modified marks and NONE of the deleted ones, silently, for every
// household in town.
//
// This read goes through `identities` instead, which is the projection that
// DEFINES the handle → key mapping and the one `householdKeyFor` reads to write
// the claim. Asking it here is asking the same question the write asked, so the
// two cannot come apart the way the two columns have. `journalHousehold`
// optionally widens it for the registry-lag case the fold names — "registry lag
// never blocks a new resident, it only leaves them ungrouped" — where a handle
// has acts but no roster line yet.
//
// ── AND `identities.household` IS ITSELF SPELLED TWO WAYS ───────────────────
//
// The paragraph above is now true one hop further in. `identities.household` is
// a projection of the WORLD repo's copy of the town's pins, and it carries
// whatever spelling that copy happened to hold when each row landed: measured
// 2026-09-22 on the live registry, 173 of 190 handles wore `gh:<id>` and 17
// wore `hh:<slug>`, and umbraliminalis wore BOTH AT ONCE because a ledger re-key
// had reached its first resident and not its other seven. So `household = $1`
// against a `hh:`-keyed session returned two of that house's eight residents,
// and the overlay lost the other six's withdrawals with nothing to say so.
//
// `= ANY($1)` is the spelling set — the same one 024's policy compares against.
// The store does not re-spell `identities` either: `law_ingester` owns every row
// of it, which is POS-160's second STOP and not this ship's.

// HOLDING — `attachments` over `acts`, in two eras
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// ── THE TWO ERAS, WHICH IS WHERE THIS PORT GOES WRONG ───────────────────────
//
// | era | how identified | payload | source of the mapping |
// |---|---|---|---|
// | `legacy` | `action = 'legacy:attachment'` | the STATE/log event: `{at, seq, type:"attachment", actor, payload:{policy, target, declared_by}}` | dynamic-rebuild.mjs `attachmentsFromState`, and crossing-save.mjs's own writer of that line |
// | `live`   | `action ∈ (give, drop, take)`, class `holding` | mirrorLaneAct's own: `{thing, holder, previous_holder, made_by, policy}` | world-hold.mjs § mirrorHoldingAct |
//
// **THE `actor` COLUMN MEANS DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE TWO ERAS, and that is the
// trap this whole section exists to not fall into.** In the legacy era the log
// event's `actor` is the ENTITY — crossing-save writes `actor: a.entity` — so
// the holder rides the actor column. In the live era `mirrorLaneAct` is called
// with `actor: did.declared_by`, so the actor is the DECLARER and the entity is
// in the payload. A port that read `acts.actor` as the entity in both would hand
// every given thing back to the giver.
//
// The live era's entity is `payload.holder ?? acts.actor`, and that is exact for
// all three faces rather than a fallback that happens to work. `declareHolding`:
//
//   const entity = act === "drop" ? actor : (act === "take" ? actor : to);
//   …
//   holder: act === "drop" ? null : entity,
//
// so `holder` IS the entity for give and take, and `null` for drop — whose
// entity is the actor. One expression covers the three because the record was
// written by one expression.
//
// ── COVERAGE, MEASURED (2026-08-28) ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The brief asked for this honestly, so it is measured rather than assumed:
//
//   43   `legacy:attachment` acts on `world2_dev`
//   43   attachment events in the world repo's STATE/log at `settlement/S47`
//        (= `sandbox/seed`, what the seed read) AND at `settlement/S50`
//   43   attachments in STATE/snapshot/150's boundary — the whole table, saved
//    0   rows in `/srv/world2-lab/office/dynamic.db` `attachments`
//    0   rows in `/srv/postmark-office-dev/dynamic.db` `attachments`
//    0   `give`/`drop`/`take` acts (the live mirror shipped 2026-08-28; nothing
//        has been picked up since)
//
// So `acts` holds the COMPLETE holdings record and the 1.0 stores on this box
// hold none of it. That inverts the usual disclosure: the coverage gap is not in
// `acts`, it is in the sqlite side, and the equality falsifier therefore cannot
// use a live `attachments` table as its oracle. It rebuilds one with 1.0's own
// `attachmentsFromState` + `declareAttachment` instead — the same chain
// `dynamic-rebuild.mjs` runs — which is 1.0's own recovery covenant, and the
// covenant is exactly the claim under test. `DISCLOSURES.holdings_source` says
// this on every answer.

//
// `readJournal(db, { cls: "holding" })` is the OTHER half of what a holder
// question needs, and the two are not the same read. The attachments half above
// answers WHO HOLDS IT; this one answers WHERE IT WAS SET DOWN — world-hold.mjs
// § latestDrop reads a `drop` act's witnessed line, and the-town/the-reach makes
// that position canon at the next fold rather than a fall-back to the last place
// the thing was folded.
//
// ⚑ THE ANCHOR IS THREE COLUMNS, NOT A PAYLOAD KEY, and this is the fact the
// port has to carry. A journal row's witnessed line is stored as
// `at_anchor / at_dx / at_dy` (world-journal.mjs § ROW_COLUMNS) and `hydrateRow`
// reassembles it into the one `at` field the ruling named. `holdingEntry`'s
// payload is `{thing, holder, previous_holder, made_by, policy}` and has never
// carried the line at all. `acts` holds the SAME three columns
// (001_tables.sql § acts), written by both pens — `mirrorAct` and `insertAct`
// name them in their INSERT lists — so the composition here is `hydrateRow`'s
// own expression and not a second reading of a payload.
//
// ⚑ THE ORDER IS `(at, id)` AND NOT `journal_seq`. 001's own words call
// `journal_seq` the shadow-era pairing key that dies at cutover, and a flipped
// lane writes Postgres FIRST — so at insert there is no sqlite rowid to carry
// and the column is null on exactly the rows a flipped town writes. D6 ruled
// replay order is `(at, id)`; ordering a holding read by a pairing key would put
// a town's own set-downs last, or nowhere.
//
// ⚑ THE PREDICATE IS `class`, BECAUSE THAT IS THE PREDICATE. `readJournal`'s
// `cls` filter is `class = ?` and nothing narrower; an `action IN (…)` filter
// here would be a DIFFERENT predicate wearing this one's name, and it would
// silently drop the first holding verb somebody adds.
//
// SECOND READER OF THIS CLASS, said out loud so POS-153 can share it:
// `world-hold.mjs § readHoldEffects` reads the same `class = 'holding'` rows out
// of sqlite for a different question (the effects shelf, scoped by handle rather
// than by thing). When that one ports, it wants this function with the `thing`
// narrowing dropped and a handle filter in its place — not a second query.

 * a resident reads. So the columns below are `hydrateRow`'s complete set rather
 * than the first caller's, and the SELECT carries them; a mapper narrowed to its
 * first consumer is a mapper the second one has to widen, which is how a second
 * copy gets born.
 *
 * `witnesses` and `effect` are here for the same reason and are read by neither
 * caller today: they are columns `hydrateRow` returns, and a row that claims to
 * be a journal row and silently drops two of its fields is a shape that agrees
 * with nothing. A fixture that omits them (POS-162's `holdingAct` does) yields
 * null, which is what the journal answers for an unset column.
 *
 * `at` IS TEXT IN THE JOURNAL AND `timestamptz` IN `acts`, so the driver hands
 * back a Date where `holdEffectsFrom` puts `written_at` straight into its
 * answer. The one visible difference this port makes to any answer is precision:
 * the journal held the stamp exactly as the door wrote it (`…:16Z`), a Date
 * round-trips to milliseconds (`…:16.000Z`). Same instant, one more field of it.

// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// The section above answers "who holds what" out of the ATTACHMENTS edge. This
// one answers a different question out of the same acts: what HAPPENED to a
// thing — the give/drop/take events themselves, in the journal's own row shape.
// Three 1.0 readers wanted it (POS-153): `groundWithinReach`'s set-down source,
// `whereThingStands`'s `latestDrop`, and the `since:` shelf's hold effects.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT A LIKE-FOR-LIKE PORT — THE STORE HOLDS MORE ─────────────
//
// The sqlite journal's holding rows are a WINDOW, and a narrow one, for two
// independent reasons that compound:
//
//   1. UNFLIPPED, A HOLDING ACT TAKES NO JOURNAL ROW AT ALL. `declareHolding`
//      writes the `attachments` edge and `mirrorHoldingAct` calls
//      `mirrorLaneAct` → `mirrorAct` → INSERT INTO `acts`, and nothing else.
//      world-journal.mjs names this itself (§ THE LANE HOOK · "an act the
//      sqlite journal never held"): a SAY, a HOLDING and a movement-v2 WALK are
//      the three acts with no journal row. So every holding act written before
//      the hold lane's pen flipped is in `acts` and in no journal, ever.
//   2. FLIPPED, THE JOURNAL ROW IS A BEST-EFFORT COPY. `LANE_FLIPPED_AT.hold`
//      is 2026-09-03T18:58:05Z: since then `appendActFlipped` commits Postgres
//      FIRST and then writes the sqlite row, and a failure there is logged and
//      swallowed by design ("the record is already committed; the convenience
//      copy failed"). And `world-drain.mjs` truncates the journal at each drain.
//
// So reading `acts` is a widening, not a translation, and the readers that take
// it stop losing set-downs to the drain.
//
// ── THE ORDER IS `(at, id)`, AND `journal_seq` IS THE TRAP ──────────────────
//
// POS-152's finding, and it binds harder here: `hold` flipped BEFORE `frame`
// did, so every flipped-era holding row was written Postgres-first with no
// sqlite seq in hand — `journal_seq` is NULL for the whole live era by the
// write path's own design (world2-pen.mjs § `seq` IS NULL HERE, AND THAT IS THE
// POINT). Ordering by the column whose NAME says "the order" would sort the
// live era into one undefined heap. `(at, id)` is D6's ruled replay order.
//
// ── CLASS ONLY, NEVER AN ACTION LIST ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `readJournal(db, { cls })` filters on the class column and nothing else, so
// this does too. An `action IN ('give','drop','take')` narrowing would read as
// harmless today and would silently DROP a fourth face the day the hold lane
// grows one — a narrowing the reader being replaced does not have. The frozen
// era cannot leak in through the class: `seed-import.mjs` files every imported
// event as `class = 'legacy'` ("one word that is in neither census keeps 2,400
// imported rows from voting in a vocabulary they predate"), so a
// `legacy:attachment` act is invisible here and reaches `liveHolder` through
// `pgAttachmentsFor` above, where its own era mapping is written.

 * `readJournal(db, { cls: "holding" })`, over `acts`. Oldest first.

 * `since` / `until` are CROSSING bounds and both are optional. They exist
 * because the `since:` shelf already narrows by crossing in JS
 * (`holdEffectsFrom`: `c < sinceCrossing || c > nowCrossing` → skip), and
 * pushing a bound it is going to apply anyway costs one clause and saves the
 * whole frozen prefix.
 *
 * ⚑ A BOUND IS PUSHED ONLY WHEN IT IS A FINITE NUMBER, and that is not defensive
 * typing — it is the equality. `holdEffectsFrom` is called with `sinceCrossing`
 * UNDEFINED on every read that carries no cursor, and `c < undefined` is false,
 * so an undefined bound filters NOTHING there. `crossing >= NULL` in SQL matches
 * nothing at all. The two would disagree completely on the commonest call, so
 * the guard is what makes the narrowed read and the unnarrowed one the same
 * answer. The JS filter still runs afterwards and is still the one that decides.
 *
