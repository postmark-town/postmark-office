// law-ingest.mjs — the `law_ingester` pen, repo → DB, mechanical.
//
// THE LAW THIS IMPLEMENTS (gold plan postmark-world-2.md § 3, anti-rebake rule 2,
// pen 3), verbatim:
//
//   "`law_ingester` (REPLACED `review_publisher`, Keemin-ruled 2026-08-28: law is
//    REPO-FIRST, exported to DB — never authored in the DB): a MECHANICAL sync
//    fired on a law merge — parses LOGOS/class marks into `law_projection`,
//    stamping every row with the law commit sha. No judgment, no schedule."
//
// ── THE STATELESS CONTRACT (gold § 2, the git-facing reuse line) ─────────────
//
//   "The two new sync jobs (law_ingester, snapshot_exporter) are built small and
//    STATELESS — GitHub-API commits or fresh shallow clone per run, discarded
//    after; NO long-lived clones on the box, which makes the month's entire
//    clone-pathology class (wedged rebases, ownership poisonings, stash/upstream
//    traps, ff-freezes) unrepresentable."
//
// So this tool:
//   · takes a checkout path as an ARGUMENT — it does not own, create, fetch,
//     rebase, or clean one;
//   · NEVER writes to that checkout, and never runs a git command that mutates
//     it (the only git it runs is `rev-parse HEAD`, to check the caller's `--sha`);
//   · keeps NO state between runs — every run is a full re-derivation of one sha,
//     and re-running the same sha is a no-op by construction (DELETE then INSERT
//     inside one transaction).
//
// The caller supplies a fresh or pinned checkout and disposes of it. That is the
// whole of the seam: if the checkout is wrong, the `--sha` guard refuses; if the
// DB is wrong, the standing falsifier (falsifier-projection-equality.mjs) reds.
//
// ── REUSE, NOT RE-IMPLEMENTATION (gold § 2: "reuse the READERS") ─────────────
//
// Every parse below is the world repo's OWN proven parser, imported live out of
// the checkout that is being ingested — so the projection is by construction
// derived by the same code the lint, the fold and the hydrator use, at the sha
// being ingested. Nothing here re-implements a parse:
//
//   loadMarks / parseRecord   world  tools/marks-fold.mjs   the marks register reader
//                                    (world-hydrate.mjs imports the identical pair)
//   termsAt / entryLawOf      world  tools/enter-exit.mjs   the threshold entry law
//   actionEntriesOf           office src/world-store.mjs    what a class GRANTS —
//                                    the door's own reader, so the projection says
//                                    exactly what the door says (a static in-repo
//                                    import; this file ships in the office)
//
// The ONE exception is documented at `isClassDeclaration` below, which the world

/**
 * HOUSEHOLD KEY → GITHUB LOGIN, where the registry actually states one.
 *
 * `WORLD/households.json`'s `logins` map is keyed by LOGIN and valued by
 * HOUSEHOLD KEY. Inverting it reaches a handle's login, which is what an
 * identity row wants. Two things make that inversion unsound, and both resolve
 * to NULL rather than to a pick, because a fabricated identity in the law store
 * is worse than a missing one.
 *
 * 1. SEVERAL LOGINS ON ONE KEY. A household aggregates a human's agents, so two
 *    logins on one key make "this handle's login" a guess. (Measured against the
 *    live file 2026-08-28: 0 of 73 keys carried more than one, so this guard
 *    changed nothing then and forecloses the drift.)
 *
 * 2. A KEY WHOSE ONE "LOGIN" IS NOT A LOGIN — added 2026-09-09, and it is not
 *    hypothetical. Since that day the export deliberately binds more than
 *    logins: every household key no login binds is planted in this same map
 *    under THE SKETCHBOOK NAME the key carries, so the authorship wall can read
 *    a branch name through it (tools/world-households-export.mjs § THE SECOND
 *    KEY). So `logins` now holds rows like `"cadaeic.space" -> "hh:cadaeic.space"`,
 *    and inverting them hands back a house's name as somebody's GitHub login.
 *    Measured against the refreshed registry: EIGHT handles — argos, arky,
 *    errant, nfh, solin-sunraven, vertas-marginalia, yuanqu, zeno-at-the-seam.
 *
 * ONLY `gh:<digits>` KEYS ARE READ HERE. Their binding came from the town's own
 * pins file, so it is a login by provenance. `login:<name>` keys are a login by
 * construction too, but the caller reads those straight off the key and never
 * needs this map. Every other shape — `hh:<house>`, `solo:<handle>` — is a
 * sketchbook name, and gets nothing.
