// materialize.mjs — HOW A CLAIM BECOMES A MARK, and how standing is re-walked
// after it does. Extracted from `clearing-job.mjs` (steps 6 and 7) the day a
// SECOND lawful writer of `marks` appeared: the REVIEW lane's ruling on a
// `held_review` contest (`review-rule.mjs`, census Decision 2's "a mind rules").
//
// IT IS AN EXTRACTION, NOT A SECOND COPY, and that is the whole reason this file
// exists. `mark-standing.mjs` states the rule one level up — "One definition,
// five consumers … a second copy of this walk is a future drift; import it" —
// and a candle and a ruling that materialized a claim two slightly different
// ways would be that drift with a schema. The clearing job calls these; the
// ruling calls these; there is one answer to "what does a locked claim become".
//
// THE PEN IS STILL ONE. Both callers connect as `clearing_job` — the only role
// holding INSERT/UPDATE on `marks` and UPDATE on `claims` (002_grants.sql) — so
// extracting the code adds no writer. What changed is that two TOOLS now hold
// that one pen, which is exactly why the law had to leave the tool it grew up
// in.
//
// Nothing here opens a connection or a transaction. Every function takes the
// caller's `q(text, args)` and runs inside the caller's transaction, because a
// materialization that could commit on its own would be a second candle.

/**
 * THE OWNERSHIP GRAIN IS THE CLAIMANT'S, RESOLVED — never the claim's scope
 * label (2026-09-02, the flip week's first catch; the standing falsifier's
 * symmetric attribution exposed it same morning it landed).
 *
 * `claims.household` answers a DIFFERENT question: whose eyes may see this
 * draft — the acting KEY's household name, and for a human-credentialed act
 * that is the human's GitHub login (world2-claims.mjs § THE ONE RESOLVER:
 * flipping it would break my-drafts parity). Copying it into `marks.household`
 * made the login the ownership grain on 26 standing rows across 12 households
 * (berthillon's cones as solo:devadavisson, sage-reeves' welcomes as
 * solo:kristinashoultz-wq, pando-peak-home as solo:FluffUPando …), and the
 * standing walk then refused sovereignty on the resident's own parcel —
 * fold says home, port says market, and the PORT was right about a store that
 * was wrong. Two questions, one column, exactly the words-for-one-fact class.
 *
 * So the mark's household resolves from the CLAIMANT (the resident who owns
 * the mark), never from the claim's scope label. The sibling resolver in
 * world2-claims.mjs stays untouched and keeps its lane.
 *
 * ── AND IT NO LONGER READS `identities` (POS-160 follow-up, RED 2) ──────────
 *
 * The 08-28 spelling was "the roster's household KEY, else solo:<handle>", and
 * the roster it meant was `identities` — a projection of the WORLD repo's copy
 * of the town's pins, four hops from the fact, answering in whatever spelling
 * that copy happened to carry. MEASURED 2026-09-22: `gh:<id>` on 173 handles,
 * `hh:<slug>` on 17, and one house wearing both at once.
 *
 * #165's lane flagged this function as THE SOURCE of the multi-spelling store:
 * `claims.household` is the acting key's and `marks.household` was copied from
 * `identities`, so between them the pen minted `gh:`, `hh:` and `solo:` rows
 * and then the read side had to reconcile them with a spelling set. Ruling 1
 * and the design note say every NEW line from the law date names `hh:<slug>`.
 * So this function now asks the ONE DERIVER, against the registry in the
 * caller's own store, and answers `hh:<slug>`.
 *
 * ── IT REFUSES A HOUSELESS CLAIMANT. IT DOES NOT FALL BACK ──────────────────
 *
 * `solo:<handle>` is gone from this pen, and that is the point rather than a
 * side effect: every `solo:` row the store holds was minted by a fallback
 * exactly here, and a fallback that keeps minting them makes the spelling set
 * a permanent fixture instead of a bridge over a closed history. After
 * POS-159's backfill the case does not arise — every resident on the roll
 * stands in exactly one house, 188 of 188 by account — so a claimant the
 * registry cannot name is a genuine defect in the roll and a person should see
 * it, at the crossing, rather than read it as a household six weeks later.
 *
 * TWO REFUSALS AND NOT ONE, because `NULL IS NOT EMPTY` (registry-store.mjs's
 * own rule) and the two failures want different hands:
 *
 *   NO_RECORD (503)      the registry holds no houses at all — this store is
 *                        not pointed at the record, or the tables are unseeded.
 *                        An operator problem, and refusing every claimant on
 *                        one reading is louder and truer than naming them one
 *                        at a time.
 *   NO_SUCH_HOUSE (404)  the roll is readable and does not name this claimant.
 *                        One person's row to fix, in the join ceremony.
 *
 * The vocabulary is `src/ceremony.mjs § REFUSALS` verbatim — the same sentences
 * the join door says, because "a refusal a resident meets at two doors in two
 * wordings is two laws wearing one name."
 *
 * ── THE MEMO MOVED INTO THE DERIVER, ON PURPOSE ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `ownerKeys` Map this replaced was keyed on the HANDLE alone and lived for
 * the life of the process, so two stores in one process (a suite's stub and a
 * real pool; a replay and a live arm) shared one answer and `__clearHouseCache`
 * could not reach it. `houseOfVia` memoises per (queryable, x) in a WeakMap and
 * IS cleared by that seam, so the cache is now scoped to the store it came
 * from. `queryableFor` keeps ONE adapter object per `q` for the same reason —
 * a fresh `{ query }` per claim would defeat the WeakMap and put the whole
 * registry fold through `registryFromRows` on every line of a crossing.

/**
 * THE RETIREMENT — the inverse of `materializeClaims`, and the only path by
 * which a standing mark stops standing.
 *
 * ── WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN A NEW FILE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `marks` has exactly one pen — `clearing_job` holds INSERT, UPDATE on it
 * (002_grants.sql:22) — and this file is where that pen's answers to "what
 * becomes of a mark" live. A retirement written anywhere else would be a second
 * place to read the register's law, which is the drift `mark-standing.mjs`'s
 * header forbids one level up. No new grant is needed and none is asked for.
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS CLOSES, MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT ───────────────────────
 *
 * Until this function existed, NOTHING in the live write path ever set
 * `marks.status = 'retired'`. 001_tables.sql has carried the column and its
 * CHECK since the first migration; the only writers in the tree were
 * `replay-ingest.mjs`'s backfill and `falsifier-standing-equality.mjs`'s own
 * can-fail fixture. So a mark the world unpublished stayed `standing` in the
 * store forever, and on the pre-cutover dump that read 1,019 standing / 0
 * retired, ever.
 *
 * IT IS WORSE THAN A STALE ROW, and this is the reason the step is worth a
 * transaction rather than a nightly tidy. `recomputeStanding` above walks
 * `WHERE status = 'standing'`, and standing is a fact about the ground a mark
 * stands on — so a mark that should have been retired keeps holding ground
 * under its neighbours and hands them a tier the fold does not agree with.
 * That is the `berthillon/chez-antoine` mechanism in this file's own comment,
 * running backwards. Retiring correctly is what removes the phantom ground,
 * which is why the caller runs this BEFORE the recompute, never after.
 *
 * ── WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CLAIM, AND WHY NOTHING ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The locking claim is left exactly as it stands. `retracted` is the docket's
 * word for a claim that never locked — `world2-claims.mjs:234-237` only ever
 * moves a `pending` row there — and the docket's own guard forbids deleting a
 * locked one. The claim is the historical fact that this mark WAS ruled in at
 * that window, and that fact did not stop being true when the world let the
 * mark go. The retirement is a fact about the mark's standing today; the claim
 * is a fact about a window that has closed. Writing the retirement onto the
 * claim would collapse two different times into one row.
 *
 * ── IDEMPOTENT BY THE GUARD, NOT BY A CHECK-THEN-WRITE ─────────────────────
 *
 * `AND status = 'standing'` is what makes a re-run a no-op, and it is in the
 * UPDATE rather than in a preceding SELECT on purpose: a check-then-write over
 * a connection two crossings could share is a race with a comfortable shape.
 * A slug already retired reports as `already_retired`, not as an error and not
 * as a silent success — a caller re-running after a half-finished crossing has
 * to be able to tell "I did this" from "this was already done".
 *
 * A slug the register does not carry at all is `absent`, and that is also not
 * an error: the world can unpublish a mark the store never materialized (a
 * founding-estate row, or one whose claim was never locked here), and refusing
 * the whole crossing over it would make the store's ignorance the town's
 * problem. It is REPORTED, because a step that quietly did nothing is the
 * failure mode this whole seam exists to end.
 *
 * ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP, AS A DIFF RATHER THAN A DESCRIPTION ─────────────────
 *
 * My first write-up said "the UPDATE replaced by a SELECT that returns no
 * rows", and a reader cannot run that sentence: the fake register in
 * `test/retire-marks.test.mjs` THROWS on SQL it does not model, so most
 * spellings of that sentence produce an error rather than the split I reported.
 * The flip is therefore recorded as the exact four-line edit it was, applied to
 * the UPDATE below:
 *
 *     -    const { rows } = await q(
 *     -      `UPDATE marks SET status = 'retired', retired_window = $2
 *     -        WHERE slug = $1 AND status = 'standing'
 *     -        RETURNING slug, locked_window`,
 *     -      [slug, windowId]);
 *     +    const { rows } = await q(
 *     +      `SELECT status, retired_window FROM marks WHERE slug = $1 AND FALSE`,
 *     +      [slug, windowId]);
 *
 * It is the SELECT the register already models (the second branch of its `q`),
 * so it returns rows instead of throwing — which is what makes this flip
 * runnable at all, and is exactly the detail the prose lost.
 *
 * Run on the committed tree, the split it produces is recorded in
 * `test/retire-marks.test.mjs`'s header beside the tests it reds.
 *
 * @param q      the caller's query function — this runs INSIDE the caller's
 *               transaction, like every other function in this file.
 * @param slugs  the `<owner>/<name>` identities the world no longer carries.
 * @param windowId  the window this retirement is ruled at; lands in
 *               `retired_window`, which is the column 001 gave it — NOT
 *               `locked_window`, which records when the mark was ruled IN.
 * @param cause  a short word naming which door the mark left canon by, carried
 *               into the receipt so a keeper reading it knows what happened
 *               rather than only that something did.
