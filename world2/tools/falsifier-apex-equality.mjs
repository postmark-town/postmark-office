// falsifier-apex-equality.mjs — the guard on the APEX door's port.
//
// `/world2/apex` answers the orientation question out of Postgres:
// `law_projection` for the affordances, `marks` + the skeleton rows for the
// world the engine judges. The runbook's GO for B2 is one sentence:
//
//   "a /world2/apex answer at a given standpoint is field-for-field equal to
//    GET /world/apex at the same standpoint, across a sampled set of
//    standpoints, with granted/actions/terms composed from law_projection at
//    the window's pinned law_sha; an equality falsifier carrying the same
//    --prove-can-fail shape as its five siblings."
//
// This is that falsifier, and it is the live lane's design one door over:
//
//   RUN BOTH, OVER THE SAME STATE, AND NAME EVERY FIELD THEY DISAGREE ABOUT.
//
// Every oracle below is 1.0's OWN function, imported live — `worldApex`,
// `gatherActions`, `gatherGroundActions`, `residueOf`, `buildTerms`. Nothing
// here re-expresses what it is judging. Where the two sides share a function on
// purpose (`buildTerms`, `resolveGrants`, `fieldsFor`) the equality is about the
// DATA those functions were handed, which is the only thing this lane changed.
//
// ── THE EQUALITIES, AND WHAT EACH ONE COULD CATCH ───────────────────────────
//
//   A1 GRANTED        1.0's `granted` block against the port's, per standpoint.
//                     Catches: a class the projection's gate admits and the
//                     store's does not (or the reverse), a lost `ambient:`, a
//                     ground channel that resolved to a different class.
//   A2 ACTIONS        the whole card set, per standpoint, field by field:
//                     action · via · channel · from · class · grant · blurb ·
//                     blurb_from · dials · fields · dispatches_to. Catches: a
//                     blurb quoted from the wrong residue, a dropped `fields`
//                     grammar, the ground/ambient precedence resolving the
//                     other way, a `for: human` grant married to the resident
//                     declaration by a name-join.
//   A3 WITHIN         the containment spine, id-for-id AND field-for-field.
//                     Catches: a mark record assembled with the wrong
//                     `at`/`extent`/`points`, a lost `points:` ring (which
//                     silently falls back to the bbox), a `by`/`tier` swap.
//   A4 NEARBY         the field of view: the id SET and the ORDER. Order is
//                     load-bearing — it is the salience ranking, and `lodScore`
//                     reads `mark.weight`, which 2.0's store cannot supply.
//                     This equality is the instrument that MEASURES that gap
//                     rather than a comment asserting it.
//   A5 TERMS          seam 2's block, built by 1.0's own `buildTerms` from BOTH
//                     sides' law, for every action at every standpoint. This is
//                     the runbook's NO-GO made checkable: "terms composed from
//                     anything but law_projection would rebuild the S39 class
//                     the projection exists to make catchable."
//   A6 PRESENT        the roll near the point — the live port, in the apex's
//                     own render.
//   A7 THE KEY SET    every top-level key one answer carries and the other does
//                     not. The equality nobody writes, and the one that catches
//                     a field quietly going missing rather than going wrong.
//   A8 RECORDS        the `records` block (#2896): the id SET both answers name
//                     — the spine, the field of view, the town's ground, the
//                     mover's class — and every published field of every
//                     record, id by id. A7 catches the block going missing;
//                     this catches a record inside it going missing or going
//                     wrong: a `parent` read off the directory instead of the
//                     authored line, a `tier` the store has not recomputed, a
//                     `declared_household` the clearing wrote from a stale
//                     roster. The seven fields no row holds are acknowledged
//                     BY NAME (AD-5, AD-6) and absent, never zero.
//
// ── EXIT CODES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   0  every equality holds
//   1  RED — a divergence, named, with the 1.0 line that produces it
//   2  CANNOT RUN
//
// There is no code for "checked nothing and found nothing". A sample that could
// not be built, a standpoint class the store does not hold, or an equality that
// ended up comparing zero rows all exit 2, loudly. Each equality reports its own
// `compared`.
//
// ── DIVERGENCES THAT ARE EXPECTED, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A LOOPHOLE ───────────
//
// Some fields cannot agree yet and the reason is structural, not a bug in the
// port — `mark.weight` has no escrow view to come from (P-006, ruled and
// unbuilt), and the frame fold is refused by the live port. A falsifier that
// simply ignored them would be a green that means nothing.
//
// So they are ACKNOWLEDGED, not exempted: each one is declared below with the
// 1.0 line that produces it, it is reported in full every run with its measured
// size, and `--strict` turns every one of them back into a RED. The default run
// is AMBER on an acknowledged divergence — exit 0 with the divergence printed —
// and RED on any other. An acknowledged divergence that STOPS happening is also
// reported, because a guard nobody can see going stale is the staleness class
// this whole lane exists to kill.

  // ── AND THE SECOND SOURCE, WHICH IS THE ONE THE APEX ACTUALLY READS ───────
  //
  // 1.0's apex `present` does NOT read the walk ledger. `dynamic-presence.mjs`
  // :99 opens the DYNAMIC STORE — `const deps = governingDepartures(db)` over
  // the crystallized `entities` table, merged with that store's own
  // `movements` — and the file says what that costs: "The entities table is a
  // CRYSTALLIZATION, refreshed on a tick … between the freeze and the next
  // refresh it was answering from a table that predated the record."
  //
  // So a handle can have the SAME governing departure in both records above and
  // still be placed differently, because the bake has not caught up. Found this
  // way: `postmaster`, whose journal departure to their own waiting-room parcel
  // stands identically in the frozen ledger and in `acts`, and whom 1.0's apex
  // placed at the parcel centre (source `parcel`) while the port placed at the
  // walk's arrival point (source `walk`).
  //
  // Those rows are excluded and NAMED. They are not an acknowledged field —
  // every other rendered field of every other resident still has to match, so
  // A6 can still fail — and the 2.0 answer is the fresher of the two, which is
