// state-log-write.mjs — THE WRITER, AND THE CHECK. What puts the photograph on
// main once the drain is gone, and the reason it commits rather than leaving
// files behind.
//
// ── WHAT POS-155 MEASURED FIRST, AND IT CHANGED THE LANE ─────────────────────
//
// The lane opened on the premise that `STATE/log/<N>.journal.jsonl` is "still
// being written" and that G1 is what threatens it. Measured on world
// `origin/main` at `17fa4195` (2026-09-22), both halves of that are wrong, and
// the correction is the reason this file gained a `--check`:
//
//   `STATE/log` holds TWO FAMILIES with two pens, two grammars and two readers.
//
//     `<c>.journal.jsonl`  the DRAIN's act journal — this module's file.
//                          Last written 2026-09-11 05:45:06Z (`4d491498`,
//                          "drain: journal windows 181 … 182.2538"). 610 files,
//                          1,486 lines, 19 act types. DARK FOR ELEVEN DAYS: the
//                          store path runs no drain, so the swap already turned
//                          this off. G1 is not the threat; G1 already happened.
//
//     `<N>.jsonl`          `tools/crossing-save.mjs`'s entity/event snapshot,
//                          committed a couple of minutes after each ferry
//                          crossing (205 at 12:02:36Z, 204 at 00:04:38Z) and alive
//                          (`17fa4195`, "crossing-save 205"). Its meta carries
//                          `covers_from` / `covers_to` / `complete`; its types
//                          are `departure`, `attachment`, `emission`. A
//                          DIFFERENT FILE that happens to share a directory.
//
//   The three world-repo readers this lane was pointed at read the SECOND
//   family, not this one. All three funnel through `tools/movement-records.mjs
//   § storeRecords`, which globs `*.jsonl` — so it opens both — and then keeps
//   only `ev.type === "departure"`, a type no journal line has ever carried
//   across all 1,486 of them (the 19 are enter, exit, walk, say, amend, strike,
//   cast, leave-mark, join, leave, pass, lift, loot, take, drop, give, guard,
//   withdraw, declare-stance-on). `boarding-flip-disclosure.mjs` and
//   `position-seed-manifest.mjs` inherit that through `storeRecords` rather
//   than reading the directory themselves.
//
// The line grammar still stays the journal's, for the drain's own reason — the
// merge-by-seq in `writeJournalWindow` — but the argument for it is reuse of
// the pen, not a reader that would break.
//
// ── AND THE CANDLE WINDOW IS NOT THE FERRY CROSSING ──────────────────────────
//
// The crossing step knows `$DOCKET_WINDOW`: the CANDLE window it just closed.
// That number is not this file's key, and the two intervals do not coincide.
//
//   the candle window N   tiles 12h forward from window 150's close.
//                         `018_settlements.sql`: "S47 (2026-08-26T05:45:16Z)
//                         closed window 150 to the second"; "window 194 locked
//                         at 2026-09-17T05:45:45.550Z". 194 − 150 = 44, and
//                         2026-08-26T05:45Z + 44 × 12h = 2026-09-17T05:45Z — a
//                         rigid tile, because `clearing-job.mjs:488` opens
//                         window N+1 at window N's RECORDED close plus twelve
//                         hours, not at the instant the clearing happened to
//                         run.
//
//   the ferry crossing N  runs [epoch + N·12h, epoch + (N+1)·12h) from
//                         `src/crossings.mjs § CROSSING_EPOCH_UTC` —
//                         00:00/12:00Z. `acts.crossing` is THIS clock:
//                         `currentCrossing()` for a door act, the UNFLOORED
//                         `fractionalCrossing()` for a walk, which is why the
//                         town holds `182.journal.jsonl` beside
//                         `182.2538.journal.jsonl`.
//
// So candle window 204 is [2026-09-21T17:45Z, 2026-09-22T05:45Z) while ferry
// crossing 204 is [2026-09-22T00:00Z, 2026-09-22T12:00Z): the window straddles
// TWO crossings and is offset from both by 5.75 hours. One window's acts land
// in two journal files, and neither file is finished until the next settlement
// writes into it.
//
// That is not a defect to repair — it is exactly what the drain did, and it is
// why `writeJournalWindow` MERGES BY SEQ instead of overwriting. The 2026-09-11
// drain wrote `181.journal.jsonl` a SECOND time, adding the rows the 2026-09-10
// drain's horizon had not yet reached.
//
// So `--window N` may not be handed to `stateLogFromStore` as a crossing value,
// and the file for window N is not `N.journal.jsonl`. The rule this file holds
// instead is § WINDOW_BOUNDARY, stated from the window's own number with no
// clock read anywhere in this process.
//
// ── MY REVIEWER'S FINDING, AND IT WAS RIGHT ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Lap 1 shipped the derivation and a proposed wiring diff, and did NOT ship a
// writer — I said so and treated it as lane 3's half. My reviewer's first pass
// answered that plainly: in the store era nothing writes the photograph at all,
// so the derivation had no caller and the swap would still have gone dark.
//
// The diff I proposed was worse than absent. It wrote the windows into the
// SWEEP CLONE'S WORKING TREE and left them uncommitted, on the reasoning that
// "committing STATE is the settlement pass's act". Two things are wrong with
// that and either one refuses a crossing:
//
//   1. `settlement-sweep.mjs:892` classifies the tree before it does anything —
//      `worktreeDirt` runs `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`, so an
//      UNTRACKED `STATE/log/<N>.journal.jsonl` is REAL dirt, and `:893` throws
//      `settlement sweep needs a clean checkout`. My diff would have made every
//      store crossing refuse at the clean-check, by name, for a file the diff
//      itself had just written.
//
//   2. The sentence I cited says the opposite of what the deployment does.
//      `world-drain.mjs`'s note — "committing it is the settlement pass's act,
//      or pass --commit-state" — describes the DEFAULT-OFF flag. The deployed
//      chain overrides it: `deploy/settlement-auto.sh:621` says `--commit-state`
//      "is required, not optional". So on prod the drain commits STATE itself,
//      and I quoted its off-by-default caveat as though it were the practice.
//
// So the writer commits, exactly where the drain committed, by the drain's own
// pen. Nothing is left in the tree for the sweep to trip on.
//
// ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It refuses a window the drain already photographed (`MERGE_HAZARD`): the
// register's seq is a different numbering, so re-deriving an already-written
// window ADDS a second copy of every line rather than replacing them. The
// drain's last file is `182.2538.journal.jsonl`, so every crossing value ABOVE
// 182.2538 is this pen's to own and everything at or below it is the drain's.
//
// It refuses off `main`, like the drain did, and for the drain's reason: STATE
// lives on main and the clone's checkout belongs to whoever else is using it.
//
// It writes through `world-drain.writeJournalWindow` — not a second serializer.
// That function owns the merge-by-seq and the write-through-temp-and-rename, and
// a reimplementation here is how the two would come to disagree about what a
// half-written window looks like.
