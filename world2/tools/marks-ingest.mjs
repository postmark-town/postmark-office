//
// ── THE FINDING THIS CLOSES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// PR #173 folds the World page from the store's rows. Against prod's store the
// rows fold differed from the published file by 7 marks no row held and ~50
// rows that were STALE — every one a file-side change after the 08-28 seed
// that the store never received (sweep publications of amended drafts,
// operator pre-acts, founder commits). Door-made writes reach the store through
// the clearing; nothing carried the world repo's own changes. `retire-unpublished`
// named the gap as its "DOOR B · A LAW OR HAND COMMIT ON MAIN … closing this
// door means the store learning to diff canon against its own register, which
// is a different lane". This is that lane.
//
// ── THE STORE'S AMENDMENT SHAPE, MEASURED — AND MIRRORED, NOT RE-INVENTED ───
//
// The brief pointed at the git pen (`src/leave-exec.mjs:179-190`, "supersedes
// in place: one copy, ever … every version stays in the log; canon shows the
// latest") and warned that "the append-only trigger refuses UPDATEs". Measured:
// the append-only trigger is `acts_append_only` (002_grants.sql) and guards
// `acts` alone. `marks` has ONE lawful write shape, `materialize.mjs`, and it is
// the git pen's sentence in rows:
//
//   ADD     a `locked` claim, then `materializeClaims` INSERTs the mark with the
//           claim's id.
//   AMEND   a NEW `locked` claim whose `supersedes` is the standing mark's id
//           (001: "amend-chain resolution"), then `materializeClaims` REWRITES
//           the row in place — `marks.slug` is UNIQUE, so one copy, ever — and
//           moves `locked_window` to the window that ruled this version. Every
//           version stays in the log: each is its own claim row.
//   RETIRE  `retireMarks` — `status = 'retired'`, `retired_window` — the shape
//           `retire-unpublished` writes when the sweep unpublishes a mark.
//
// That is DEC-17's admission path as `backfill-register.mjs § applyBackfill`
// already walks it for a file-side mark the store lacks. This tool calls the
// SAME `materializeClaims` and `retireMarks`: no fourth way of turning a claim
// into a mark. It differs from the backfill in exactly three places, each named:
// it stamps its own provenance (`_ingested_from`, not the backfill's
// `locked_by: founder`, which would be false here); it runs at every bless over
// the whole register rather than one class per ruling; and it gates amends and
// retires on a commit in the ingested range (§ THE RANGE GATE).
//
// ── WHAT IS COMPARED: THE RECORD THE FOLD READS ─────────────────────────────
//
// `replay-ingest`'s `SUBSTANCE_COLUMNS` leave out `data` and `parent`, which is
// how 30 images and 18 parents went stale with no gate red. So the diff here is
// in RECORD space: the store's row and the ref's derived row are both passed
// through `marksFromRows` (src/world2-fold.mjs — the function PR #173 proved is
// the loader's inverse) and compared key by key. Every key the loader carries
// counts, except the ones the store stamps and no file authors — the measured
// list in `src/mark-record.mjs § DERIVED`, imported rather than restated — and
// the parser's underscore internals, of which only `_parentMarkId` is a fact
// the fold reads (the continuation edge).
//
// ── THE RANGE GATE: AN AMEND OR A RETIRE NEEDS THE FILE TO HAVE MOVED ───────
//
// The store is allowed to be AHEAD of the blessed file: a mark a resident
// amended at the door is ruled at a window, and the sweep publishes it at a
// later crossing. A diff alone cannot tell "the store is stale" from "the file
// has not caught up", and writing the file's version over the second would
// revert a resident's act. So an amend or a retire is written only when:
//   · a commit in (base, ref] changed (or deleted) the mark's file — that commit
//     is the provenance the row records; and
//   · the store's row was ruled BEFORE that commit (`locked_window`'s close). A
//     row ruled after the file's last change is the door's later word.
// Anything else that differs is REPORTED under SKIPPED with its reason and left
// alone. An ADD reverts nothing and needs no gate; its provenance is the newest
// commit that touched its file.
//
// `base` is the store's `projection_heads['world-marks']` — the last ingested
// ref — or, before the first run, the genesis seed's world sha
// (`windows.receipts.seeded_from.world_sha`), or `--since`.
//
// ── A FACT THE ROW SHAPE CANNOT HOLD IS A STOP, NEVER A SHIM ────────────────
//
//   · a file-side mark whose slug the store holds RETIRED — `marks.slug` is
//     unique and no pen un-retires a row;
//   · a parent that is neither in the store nor in this ingest — `marks.parent`
//     is a non-deferrable FK;
//   · a head or base that is not an ancestor of the ref.
// A STOP refuses the whole run, dry or not, and names every instance.
//
// ── HELD BY NAME ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `backfill-register.mjs § REFUSED_BY_NAME` — `wright/the-lit-name`, held for
// the founder's sitting — is honoured here by the same set, imported. The dry
// run and the run both print it under HELD. Lifting the hold is a ruling, and
// the set is the one place it is lifted.
//
// ── THE DRY RUN READS THE STORE; IT CANNOT WRITE IT ─────────────────────────
//
// A diff against the store cannot be made without reading the store, so
// `--dry-run` connects — inside `BEGIN READ ONLY`, where Postgres itself refuses
// any write — derives the SAME plan the run would, prints it, and rolls back.
// One function plans both arms (the backfill's rehearsal lesson).
//
// ── THE ROLE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An ingest INSERTs claims and INSERTs/UPDATEs marks and writes its head.
// 002_grants gives those halves to different roles (office_api: claims;
// clearing_job: marks), so the one role that holds them all is the owner,
// `world2_owner` — what backfill-register and replay-ingest connect as. The
// write arm checks its grants before it writes and refuses by name.
//
// ── THE CHECKOUTS TOUCH NOTHING ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ref and the base are read through throwaway `git clone --shared
// --no-checkout` copies in the temp directory (the checkout PR #173's test
// uses). Nothing is written into the clone this is pointed at — no worktree
// registration, no checkout, no fetch — so the office's own world clone can be
// the argument while the tick holds its lock.
