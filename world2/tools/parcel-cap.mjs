// parcel-cap.mjs — THE CLEARING ASKS THE PARCEL CAP THE SWEEP ASKS.
//
// ── THE GAP, MEASURED (POS-98 box 4, the S71 instance) ──────────────────────
//
// The candle admitted Mari's parcel at window 191's close and the sweep refused
// it three minutes later. Two gates, two answers, twelve hours apart, and the
// resident learned the second one from a person.
//
// `clearing-job.mjs` steps 1-5.5 are, in full: duplicate slug, supersession,
// escrow SUFFICIENCY, parcel overlap against standing ground, the counterclaim
// rule, and commons escrow PRESENCE. Not one of them counts how many parcels a
// household holds. The cap lives in the world's own fold
// (`tools/marks-fold.mjs § PARCEL_CLAIM_CAP`, Keemin 2026-07-30) and is asked by
// `tools/settlement-sweep.mjs` AFTER the clearing has already said yes.
//
// So this is the escrow-presence move again, one gate over: the sweep's rule,
// ported to the candle, so a capped claim is refused AT THE CLOSE with its
// reason on the docket rather than by the sweep after it. The sweep's own check
// stays exactly where it is — it is the gate of last resort and this file does
// not touch it.
//
// ── THE LAW IS IMPORTED, NEVER COPIED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ──────────
//
// `PARCEL_CLAIM_CAP`, `PARCEL_CAP_LAW_DATE` and `PARCEL_CAP_EXCEPTIONS` are
// exported by the world's `tools/marks-fold.mjs`, and `parcelCapLawAt` reads
// them out of a world checkout the caller supplies — the same route
// `canon-register.mjs § canonRegisterAt` already takes to `loadMarks`, and the
// same `--world-repo` argument `falsifier-canon-locks.mjs` already takes. A
// second copy of the number, the date or the exception list is how the two gates
// come to disagree, which is the defect this file exists to end and not a new
// spelling of it.
//
// `compareClaimOrder` is imported for the same reason. The cap refuses the
// claim that arrives when the household is already full, so WHICH of several
// simultaneous claims is refused is decided entirely by the order the loop runs
// in — the world made that a function of the record rather than of a directory
// walk, and a second ordering here would undo it at this gate only.
//
// ── WHAT IS NOT IMPORTABLE, AND IS THEREFORE FLAGGED ────────────────────────
//
// THE SENTENCE. `marks-fold.mjs` composes its refusal text inline at BOTH of its
// own cap sites (:876 and :1806) and exports no function for it, so there is no
// function to import. This file composes the same sentence FROM THE SAME THREE
// CONSTANTS, which means the numbers, the date and the exception set can never
// drift — only the words could, and only if somebody re-words two inline strings
// in the world without touching this one. That is a third holder of one
// sentence, it is a real seam, and extracting it is the WORLD's to do: this lane
// is the office's and does not edit the fold.
//
// ── AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO GUESS ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An unreadable world checkout THROWS. It does not fall back to a default cap,
// an empty exception map or a permissive answer. An empty `PARCEL_CAP_EXCEPTIONS`
// is not "no exceptions granted" — it is the founder's five rulings missing, and
// it would refuse Mari's parcel again, and the Reeves' gauge house, and deva's
// household's five, on the quietest possible code path. The sibling's words for
// the same rule: "an empty set here would refuse EVERY claim at the next
// crossing, which is the loudest possible wrong answer wearing the quietest
// possible code."

 *
 * AN AMENDMENT of a parcel the household already holds (`amending`) — POS-88's
 * law, and `marks-fold.mjs:1805` spells it `!mk._replacing`: a relocation is a
 * replacement, not a second claim, and the household's count does not move.
 *
 * A PARCEL DATED ON OR BEFORE THE LAW DATE — "prior estate stands". The fold
 * compares `String(mk.date ?? "") > PARCEL_CAP_LAW_DATE`, and an ABSENT date is
 * therefore never post-law. That reading is deliberate on the world's side and
 * is kept here rather than tightened: a gate that refused an undated claim would
 * be stricter than the law it is porting.
 *
 * A MARK IN `PARCEL_CAP_EXCEPTIONS` — the founder's word, by mark id, which is
 * the slug. The count still rises for it, exactly as the fold's does: deva's
 * entry says so in its own text ("`held` still counts all five, so a SIXTH claim
 * by this household is refused").
