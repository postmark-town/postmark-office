// falsifier-projection-equality.mjs — the standing guard on the repo→DB seam.
//
// THE LAW THIS ASSERTS (gold plan postmark-world-2.md § 3, anti-rebake rule 2,
// pen 3 — quoted verbatim, because falsifiers quote their law):
//
//   "Guards on the repo→DB seam (it is two-pens-shaped): RLS makes law_ingester
//    the only law-table writer; **a standing falsifier re-derives the projection
//    from repo HEAD and asserts equality (drift = red)**; registry row says
//    derived-from-repo."
//
// The sentence this file is: *a standing falsifier re-derives the projection from
// repo HEAD and asserts equality (drift = red).*
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS, IN THE PLAN'S OWN DIAGNOSIS ────────────────────────────
//
// The seam is "two-pens-shaped" — the class of bug that cost the town three hand
// repairs in a month (gold § 0: issue #2152, "the two-pens seam … now blocks
// settlements on every lively crossing"). Two writers to one truth, and no
// mechanism that could notice they had diverged. Here the repo is authoritative
// and the DB is a projection of it, so divergence has a decidable answer: derive
// it again and compare. Drift is red, and red is loud.
//
// ── WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT CATCH (stated, so nobody trusts it further) ──────
//
// CATCHES  anything that moved a projection row without the pen: a hand UPDATE,
//          a partial or interrupted ingest, a row deleted, a stale head, a second
//          writer that RLS did not stop, a checkout ingested under the wrong sha.
//
// DOES NOT the derivation itself being wrong. This tool calls the SAME
// CATCH     `deriveLaw` / `deriveStamps` the ingester calls, deliberately — two
//           derivations would make an equality check a comparison of twins, and
//           a green would then mean only "both parsers agree", which is the
//           weaker claim. Parser correctness is the world's own lint's job.
//
// ── IT MUST BE ABLE TO FAIL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The standing red-proof, which is a receipt and not a thought experiment
// (world2/tools/README.md § the red-proof carries the run):
//
//   psql … -c "UPDATE law_projection SET data = '{}'::jsonb
//              WHERE law_sha = '<head>' AND kind = 'class' AND key = 'resident'"
//   node world2/tools/falsifier-projection-equality.mjs --law-repo … # → exit 1
//   node world2/tools/law-ingest.mjs --law-repo … --sha <head>       # idempotent restore
//   node world2/tools/falsifier-projection-equality.mjs --law-repo … # → exit 0
//
// A run of this file that has never been shown going red is not a falsifier.
//
// ── USAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

//     node world2/tools/falsifier-projection-equality.mjs \
//       --law-repo /tmp/world-at-head --town-repo /tmp/town-at-head
//
// Each checkout must be AT the sha `projection_heads` records for that repo —
// this pen never moves a checkout, and comparing against the wrong sha would
// prove nothing, so a mismatch exits 2 (cannot run) rather than 0 or 1.
