// world-snapshot-seal.mjs — THE CLEARING SEALS THE WORLD IT JUST CLEARED
// (POS-357; 054_world_snapshots.sql. POS-410; 064_snapshot_register.sql).
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-04, POS-337 R1 and "Agreed on 2"): the snapshot step
// inside the clearing's transaction is a PURE SQL COPY of rows the clearing just
// wrote: hash each standing mark's row, insert into mark_versions (on conflict do
// nothing), one world_snapshots header (shas read from the store's own tables),
// the world_snapshot_marks list. NO engine, no fold, no law evaluation, no
// network, no file reads.
//
// SO THIS FILE IMPORTS NOTHING. Every byte that is hashed is made by Postgres
// (`jsonb_build_object(...)::text`, `sha256`, `string_agg ... COLLATE "C"`), and
// this module only hands it five statements under the caller's connection,
// inside the caller's transaction. `test/world-snapshot.test.mjs` reads this
// file's import list and reds on any import at all: a fold, a world module or a
// file read here would bring the engine's failure modes into the clearing, and
// with this split the seal can only fail the clearing's own ways (a grant, a
// hashing bug), which the tests and the rehearsal catch.
//
// THE REGISTER (POS-410, 064_snapshot_register.sql; Darko 2026-10-05: "save
// whatever atomic upstream units are necessary"). Beside the marks, the seal
// copies the household register ROWS as they stand — every `households` and
// `household_pins` row, all columns, by content — so a later fold reads the
// houses of its own day, not today's. The stakes' source is the ledger
// position (`town_sha`) and the law and terrain are `law_sha`, both already on
// the header; nothing derived (escrow, the handle → household map) is copied.
//
// THE DIGESTS, defined once, here (054's and 064's headers say the same in prose):
//   version digest    sha256(row), row = the mark's canonical row as jsonb text,
//                     parent as the parent's slug
//   marks_digest      sha256 of "<slug> <digest>" lines, slug order (COLLATE "C"), "\n"-joined
//   register version  sha256(row), row = to_jsonb(<register row>) || {"table": <table>}, as text
//   register_digest   sha256 of "<key> <digest>" lines, key order (COLLATE "C"), "\n"-joined;
//                     key = "households/<slug>" | "household_pins/<handle>"
//   snapshot digest   sha256 of "<marks_digest> <law_sha> <town_sha> <world_sha> <register_digest>",
//                     "-" for an absent value, then " <stance_through>" when it is set (069),
//                     then " stances:<counted|not-counted>:<cutover|->:<settlement|->:<how>"
//                     when the decision is recorded (072)
//
// THE TOWN'S WORDS (POS-362, 069_snapshot_stance_through.sql; Darko 2026-10-08,
// option A). The opposed half of a settlement is one more source: the seal
// records the newest stance act's id, and the settlement's World folds the words
// up to it (src/world-settlement.mjs § wordsAtSeal). One max(id), nothing derived.
//
// WHETHER THEY COUNT (POS-364, 072_snapshot_stances.sql; Darko 2026-10-09, the
// conservative cutover; Wright: decide once, at the seal). The caller hands the
// decision in (`stances`, made by world-settlement.mjs § stancesAtSeal from the
// cutover and the settlement number); this file only writes it, and the digest
// covers it. Every reader reads the record and never recomputes it.
//
// `src/world-snapshot.mjs § checkSnapshot` recomputes every one in JS from the
// stored rows; that second computation is a check, never a writer.
