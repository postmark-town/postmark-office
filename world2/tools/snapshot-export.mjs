// snapshot-export.mjs — the NOTARY pen. Reads the database, writes the repo.
//
// THE LAW THIS IMPLEMENTS (gold plan postmark-world-2.md § 2 — quoted verbatim,
// because a pen should carry the sentence it is):
//
//   "Certification → the repo, as NOTARY (the anti-bucket role): periodic
//    certified snapshots binding (event-log cursor, content sha, law sha),
//    signed and tagged. Anyone can clone and verify what was certified when;
//    **the office cannot rewrite history without the repo catching it**."
//
//   "Durability obligation (named honestly): today a clone is a full off-box
//    backup, events included. After the split, events need an archive lane:
//    **each closed window exported append-only into `archives/`** — machine-
//    written but single-pen, **frozen-on-write, an input never re-derived-into**.
//    Clone-the-town becomes download-the-town."
//
// And gold § 3, anti-rebake rule 2, on this pen specifically:
//
//   "A fourth pen exists REPO-side only: `snapshot_exporter` (reads DB, writes
//    notary certifications + event archives into git — **never writes the DB**)."
//
// And census.md decision 1, the row that sends mark bodies back to the repo:
//
//   "mark BODIES | DB-source, riding the claim through the candle;
//    **`snapshot_exporter` writes bodies back to the repo so fork-and-read
//    survives**"
//
// ── THE THREE SURFACES, AND THE ONE THAT IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERS ─────────────
//
//   archives/acts/<window>.jsonl   ARCHIVE. Frozen on write. Written once, for a
//                                  CLOSED window, and never rewritten. If a
//                                  regeneration differs from a file that already
//                                  exists, this pen REFUSES and names the diff:
//                                  that is the office rewriting history, which is
//                                  the exact thing § 2 says the repo must catch.
//                                  A finding, never an overwrite.
//
//   WORLD2/marks/<slug>/mark.md    RENDER. Re-derived in full every run, because
//                                  the DB is the source (census decision 1) and
//                                  this is a view of it for fork-and-read. Editing
//                                  one of these files edits nothing: the next run
//                                  writes it back. Each file says so in its own
//                                  frontmatter, so a reader who found it by
//                                  cloning knows which kind of file they hold.
//
//   CERTIFICATION.json             The binding. (acts cursor, window cursor,
//                                  content sha, archives sha, law sha, town sha).
//                                  One commit carries all three; an annotated tag
//                                  `notary/<window>-<acts>` carries the
//                                  certification as its message.
//
// The asymmetry is the design. An archive is an input; a render is an output.
//
// ── THE STATELESS CONTRACT (gold § 3, and the sibling pens' own § in README) ─
//
// The CALLER supplies the target checkout. This pen never clones, fetches,
// creates, checks out, rebases, cleans, or pushes one, and keeps no state
// between runs — every run is a full re-derivation of the current database. It
// does commit and tag IN the caller's checkout; that is the pen's whole job.
//
// Its point is negative, exactly as § 3 states it: with no long-lived clone on
// the box, the month's whole clone-pathology class (wedged rebases, ownership
// poisonings, stash and upstream traps, ff-only freezes) is unrepresentable.
//
// ── IT MUST NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE THE DB ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The credential is `snapshot_reader`, which 002_grants.sql gives SELECT and
// nothing else. This pen additionally REFUSES to run while holding one of the
// three writing pens' roles: a notary that could edit the thing it certifies is
// not a notary, and "the role happened to be handy" is how a fourth writer gets
// born (gold § 3 rule 2).

 * fact about a file rather than a crossing boundary, and every legacy act falls
 * before it. A time bound would have archived an empty genesis window and called
 * it complete. The crossing IS the town's clock (gold § 1); the timestamps are

// ── THE TWO CLOCKS, AND WHY A CLOSED WINDOW IS NOT YET A FINISHED ONE ────────
//
// This pen selected its windows on one clock and its acts on another, and the
// two do not agree about when window N stops growing.
//
//   windows.status = 'closed'   the SETTLEMENT clock. Windows close at the
//                               06:00Z / 18:00Z clearings.
//   acts.crossing               the FERRY clock. Ferries sail 00:00Z / 12:00Z
//                               (crossings.mjs, the ratified derivation).
//
// WHICH FERRY AN ACT'S NUMBER NAMES — the direction the whole rule turns on.
// Every writer stamps `crossing: currentCrossing()` (src/world-apex.mjs,
// src/world-hold.mjs, src/world.mjs), and `currentCrossing(now)` is
// `floor((now − epoch) / 12h)` — the ferry that LAST SAILED, not the next one.
// The pen that guards the insert says so in its own variable name:
// world2-pen.mjs § lateCrossingGuard, `const open = currentCrossing(now)`, and
// it throws on `crossing > open` because "the future is not a place a row can
// file into". So an act numbered N is an act that arrived in
// [ferry N sails, ferry N+1 sails) — and window N goes on growing until ferry
// N+1 has sailed.
//
// THE INSTANCE (measured on the box, 2026-09-21/22, postmark POS-189). Ferry
// 202 sailed 2026-09-21T00:00Z. At 07:22Z the settlement clock had already
// closed window 202, and this pen froze it at 84 acts. Acts numbered 202 then
// kept arriving — id 7181 at 07:47Z, id 7182 at 09:13Z — until the 12:00Z
// ferry, which is ferry 203. The next night re-derived 94 and REFUSED, exactly
// as § 2 says it must: from the repo's side, a window that grew after it was
// frozen is indistinguishable from the office rewriting history. The refusal
// was right; freezing that early was the defect. Red stood from 09-22 07:22Z
// until a hand cleared it at 14:11Z.
//
// THE RULE THIS BUILDS: a window is archivable only once the ferry AFTER it has
// sailed. Window 204 was archivable at 14:11Z on 09-22 (ferry 205 sailed at
// 12:00Z); window 205 was not, and was correctly left alone.
//
// RESIDUAL, named because a rule should say where it stops being total:
// `world2-pen.mjs § crossingIsLate` is `c < open − 1`, so a row stamped N may
// still file without a reason while the open window is N+1 — the sub-second
// race of a row composed just before a boundary and inserted just after. This
// rule does not cover that race; holding a second ferry would, at the cost of
// twelve more hours before every archive. The notary runs at 07:22Z, seven
// hours from either boundary, so the race is not the failure that was measured.

 * the archive would be the office's accomplice.
 *
 * THE OPERATOR DOOR (`refreeze`, POS-189; the 2026-09-14 rule that every guard
 * gets an operator door with a receipt). A guard with no door is a defect: when
 * this pen itself froze a window early, the only way past its own refusal was a
 * hand removing the file from the notary repo with the reason in a commit
 * message nobody had to write. So the door is here instead — ONE window,
 * named by number, replaced by the re-derived bytes, with the old sha, the new
 * sha and the operator's reason on the commit's first line. It narrows rather
 * than widens: every other differing archive refuses exactly as before, which
