-- 026 — events + event_rsvps: the calendar's current state, and household_harnesses:
--       each resident's private harness row (POS-207, POS-208, w40)
--
-- THE SHAPE, decided by Wright 2026-09-24 and disclosed to Keemin: "The record
-- is the act log; the table is its projection." Hosting, amending, cancelling
-- and RSVPing are ACTS in `acts` (class `event`; action `host` | `amend-event`
-- | `cancel-event` | `rsvp`; object = the event's id), so every revision stays
-- visible, as Rei's blueprint asks ("Moving, canceling, or shortening an event
-- must remain visible as a revision, never a silent replacement").
--
-- These two tables hold the CURRENT state that the calendar read serves. The
-- office pen writes them in the SAME transaction as the act (src/events-store.mjs),
-- and `world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs --dry-run` rebuilds them from `acts`
-- alone and says whether the rebuild equals what is stored. Both paths take the
-- row from one pure function (src/events.mjs § applyEventAct), so the pen and
-- the rebuild cannot come to disagree about what an act means.
--
-- ── THE HARNESS ROW (ruled 2026-09-25, Keemin's go through Wright) ─────────
--
-- `acts` is the table that leaves the box: the notary exports it into a public
-- git repo, frozen on write (src/world2-pen.mjs § `act: false`). A webhook url,
-- a Letta conversation and a webhook's secret are a resident's private facts,
-- so no act carries them, and neither do `events`, `event_rsvps` or the public
-- calendar read. The rsvp act records the harness KIND and the budget.
--
-- They live on `household_harnesses`: ONE ROW PER RESIDENT, not one per RSVP.
-- The office registers a resident's harness once. A webhook is challenged
-- with a nonce once per registration, and on the echo the office mints a
-- 32-byte secret and shows it once, on that RSVP's receipt. A later RSVP naming
-- the same address reuses the row, with no challenge and no secret. A different
-- address re-challenges and re-mints (`rotated_at`). A `letta` harness stores
-- its conversation id the same way, with no secret. A `mail` RSVP stores
-- nothing and leaves the row alone.
--
-- `event_rsvps` refers to the row by `handle`, the column it already has.
-- One row per resident makes the handle the row's key, so a surrogate id would
-- be a second name for the same thing that could come to disagree with it.
--
-- THE POLICY SHAPE IS 007's (private drafts), in 024's spelling-set form:
-- ROW LEVEL SECURITY, and every policy is `TO office_api` and compares
-- `household = ANY(app.household_keys)`. A transaction that has not declared
-- this household sees no row and cannot write one. NO GRANT TO
-- `snapshot_reader` or to any role but `office_api`. Even if a later re-run of
-- 002's `GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES` reached this table, RLS with no policy for
-- that role returns it nothing. No export reads it: the notary reads `acts`,
-- `windows` and `marks` (world2/tools/snapshot-export.mjs), and a rebuild of
-- the calendar never touches it (world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs).
--
-- The secret is kept in the clear under RLS for now, as 007 keeps a draft's
-- body. Encrypting it at rest belongs to the wake delivery (POS-208 C), the
-- first thing that reads it.
--
-- ── THE PEN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `office_api`, because the household door that performs the acts connects as
-- it (the same reason 019 gives). INSERT + UPDATE and no DELETE: an amendment
-- or a cancellation UPDATEs the current row (the history is the act log), and a
-- second RSVP from the same resident replaces their first. Nothing is removed.
-- A cancelled event keeps its row and its id.
--
-- `event_rsvps` stays SELECT to `office_api` only: it names who RSVPed with
-- which kind and budget, and the public read carries only who. `events` is
-- public, like the read that serves it. `household_harnesses` is `office_api`'s
-- alone, SELECT + INSERT + UPDATE, narrowed by its row policy. No DELETE: a
-- registration is replaced, never removed.
--
-- 003_falsifier_roles.sql's lawful list carries the six matching rows in the
-- same commit, so test/registry-grants.test.mjs stays green.
--
-- ── IDEMPOTENT. APPLY AS `world2_owner` by the runbook's step-1 idiom ────────
--
--   sudo -n -u postgres psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -d world2_dev \
--     -c "SET ROLE world2_owner;" -f world2/schema/026_events.sql
--
-- A second run is a no-op: `IF NOT EXISTS` on the tables and the index, a
-- `pg_policies` check before each CREATE POLICY, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on
-- the registry rows, and a GRANT is idempotent.
--
-- ── HOW TO PROVE IT LANDED (there is no migrations table in this store) ──────
--
--   SELECT tablename, tableowner, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
--    WHERE tablename IN ('events','event_rsvps','household_harnesses');
--   SELECT table_name, grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
--    WHERE table_name IN ('events','event_rsvps','household_harnesses') ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
--      -- household_harnesses: office_api SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE and nothing else
--   SELECT policyname, roles, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'household_harnesses';
--   SELECT * FROM registry WHERE object IN ('events','event_rsvps','household_harnesses');
--   node world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs --dry-run   -- "equal"
--
-- CONSUMERS, named: src/events-store.mjs (the pen, the calendar read, and the
-- harness row's read and upsert), world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs (the rebuild
-- and its equality check; events and event_rsvps only), test/events.test.mjs
-- (through a JS stub of these tables; the stub proves the JS, not the store),
-- test/registry-grants.test.mjs (the harness table's grants and policies, read
-- from this file). Nothing else reads them yet. The site's `calendar.json`
-- ingest reads the calendar READ, never these tables.
