// suite-lib.mjs — the office suite in CI (POS-417): the plan, the reading of a
// shard's events, and the verdict. Pure functions over plain data, so
// test/suite-ci.test.mjs can drive every branch without a runner. Workflow
// machinery for .github/workflows/suite.yml, not an office tool.
//
// THE PLAN. Every test/*.test.mjs, sorted, dealt across N shards by each file's
// measured seconds (.github/suite/timings.json): longest first, each to the
// shard with the least time so far. A file with no timing (new, or never run in
// CI) is dealt at the median, so a new file never lands unplanned. Every shard
// computes the same plan from the same committed inputs, so no job hands file
// lists to another.
//
// THE VERDICT. A red is a leaf: a test that failed for its own reason, not a
// parent that failed because a subtest did. The run fails on
//   · a red that is not on test/known-failures.json (a new red);
//   · a listed test that passed (the list shrinks: delete its row), unless the
//     row is `flaky`. A flaky test that reds is run again once (its whole
//     file, by the shard): green on the retry is a flake and allowed, red twice
//     is a red and fails the run;
//   · a listed test that did not run at all (renamed or deleted: the row is stale);
//   · a planned file with no result, or a file that exited non-zero with no red
//     of its own (it crashed, or was killed: its tests vanished, they did not pass);
//   · a shard that reported nothing.
// Everything it counts is printed with its denominator.
