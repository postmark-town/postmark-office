// world2-acts.mjs — THE WORLD 2.0 SHADOW PEN (office_api's acts writer, dev era).
//
// Phase 3a of the World 2.0 gold plan (G:/Starstory/PULSE/gold-plans/
// postmark-world-2/): every row appendJournal writes into the sqlite journal is
// MIRRORED into Postgres `acts` — the permanent event log that replaces the
// journal-truncate-drain-to-git cycle at cutover. During the shadow era the
// sqlite journal remains the store the office READS; Postgres is the store
// being proven. The parity falsifier (world2/tools/falsifier-acts-parity.mjs)
// asserts every undrained journal row has its acts twin.
//
// ── THIS IS A SHIM, AND IT SHIPS WITH ITS OWN DEATH (anti-rebake rule 5) ─────
// The mirror exists so 1.0 and 2.0 can be A/B'd on the same live dev traffic
// (phase 4). At cutover the journal INSERT dies, this file's mirror becomes the
// door's ONE awaited write, and `acts.journal_seq` is dropped. The expiry
// falsifiers red past a lane's own backstop (below) so the shim cannot become
// furniture.
//
// ── WRITE DISCIPLINE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// appendJournal is synchronous; the mirror is an in-process serial queue —
// fire-and-forget FOR THE CALLER, never for the operator: a failed mirror
// write logs loudly, lands in `mirrorStatus().failed`, and the parity
// falsifier turns red at the next check. That is acceptable ONLY because the
// sqlite journal is still the SoT this era; the cutover rewrite awaits the
// insert and refuses at the door instead.
//
// Env:
//   WORLD2_PG=1        the mirror is on
//   WORLD2_PG_URL      postgres://office_api:<pw>@localhost:5432/world2_dev
//   (read per call like WORLD_SINGLE_LOG — a test flips it between cases)

// ── THE MIRROR'S EXPIRY MACHINERY IS GONE (G1 / POS-156, 2026-09-22) ─────
//
// `MIRROR_EXPIRES`, `LANE_MIRROR` and the five functions over them
// (`mirrorExpiresFor`, `laneMirrorExpired`, `expiredLanes`, `exemptLanes`,
// `mirrorExpiryLine`, `mirrorExpired`) were the pressure mechanism on a shim:
// per-lane backstop dates that RED a falsifier if a lane was still mirroring
// past them. DEC-2's own rule said what ends a lane's obligation -- "DELETING
// its row from LANE_MIRROR", ports landed and deletion ruled, never a clock
// running out -- and this file said where that happened: the map "is deleted
// whole by G1 (POS-156), with the journal INSERT".
//
// That is this change. Every governed lane's read ports have landed -- frame
// and the ride's entry stop in POS-152, hold in POS-153 and POS-162, walkers in
// POS-154, occupancy in POS-194, the stance candidates in POS-195 -- and the
// INSERT the map was pressuring is deleted in the same commit. A death clock
// outliving the thing it was counting down is furniture, which is rule 5
// pointed the other way.
//
// THE ARENA'S EXEMPTION DID NOT LIVE HERE AND DOES NOT DIE HERE. `LANE_MIRROR.
// arena.expires` was null carrying P-143's words, and the ruling itself is
// unchanged and now carried where the exception actually is: `FLIP_REFUSED` in
// `world-journal.mjs`, and `appendArenaRow`, the one sqlite INSERT G1 leaves
// standing, which refuses any other class by name. An exemption stated at the
// code that implements it is stronger than one stated in a map beside it.

/**
 * THE LANES EXEMPT BY RULING — the one thing the deleted map carried that
 * OUTLIVES it, kept because a live tool reads it and a ruling is not a shim.
 *
 * `world2/tools/state-log-rederive.mjs § classifyAbsence` asks which lanes may
 * be ABSENT from the register without that absence being a finding. That
 * question survives G1 whole: it is about the arena, and the arena's exemption
 * is P-143, which no deletion of this lane's touches.
 *
 * It used to be derived from `LANE_MIRROR` by reading which rows had a null
 * expiry — a map about the REVERSE MIRROR's death clock, which G1 deleted along
 * with the INSERT it was pressuring. The answer was never really about expiry
 * dates, so it is stated directly now:
 *
 *   P-143, RULED (Keemin, 2026-08-29 party night: "we can just keep the arena
 *   on sqlite for now") — the lane stays sqlite-first, no read port, the
 *   hardened rebuild lands 2.0-native instead. Lifting this is a founder ruling
 *   PLUS the arena read ports, together.
 *
 * ⛑ A LANE IS NOT EXEMPT BY BEING ABSENT FROM THIS LIST. That was `LANE_MIRROR`'s
 * own fail-closed rule ("an unnamed lane must never buy immortality by being
 * unnamed") and it is the same here: this names the exemptions, and everything
 * not named is governed.

// ── WHEN EACH LANE'S PEN FLIPPED — DATES AS DATA, NOT AS PROSE ───────────────
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO KILL (w2-hold-say-flip-report.md § Findings 2,
// 2026-09-03, verbatim): "`--since` is one clock for every lane, and lanes flip
// on different days. Asked for `--lanes stance,hold,say --since <the stance
// flip>`, it read 81 mirror-era say acts (`journal_seq` NULL by the mirror's
// design, never flipped) as 'flipped acts lacking twins'. The pairing key
// 'journal_seq NULL' does not distinguish a flipped row from a mirror-written
// row of a lane that never had journal rows."
//
// The pairing key CANNOT distinguish them and never will: before a lane flips,
// its mirror writes `acts` rows with `journal_seq` NULL too (the say gap and the
// holding gap were closed by the mirror, not by the journal — the lane simply
// had no journal row to carry a seq). The only thing that separates a flipped
// row from a mirror row of the same lane is WHEN — so the moment each lane's pen
// flipped is a fact the store needs written down, and this is where it lives:
// here. (It used to sit beside `LANE_MIRROR`, "the one home for per-lane truth
// about the shim"; G1 deleted that map with the journal INSERT it was
// pressuring, and these dates OUTLIVE it -- they are a fact about `W2_PEN` on a
// box, not about a shim's death clock, and the flipped-era acts they date still
// exist.) A falsifier that carried these dates in its own argv would make every
// operator re-type them, and a date re-typed is a date eventually mistyped.
//
// THE VALUE IS THE SERVICE-RESTART MOMENT, from that lane's own flip report —
// not the first act observed after it. An act is evidence the flip happened
// BEFORE it; the restart is the flip.
//
// `null` means THIS LANE HAS NOT FLIPPED. It is not "unknown" and it is not a
// backstop: a lane with a null here has no flipped era at all, so a reverse-
// parity check over it is a comparison with nothing to compare (its
// `journal_seq`-NULL rows are the mirror's, and pairing them against a journal
// that never held them manufactures exactly the 81 false reds above). A lane
// ABSENT from this map is also unflipped — nothing becomes "flipped" by being
// unnamed, which is LANE_MIRROR's own fail-closed rule pointed the other way.
//
// A lane's row changes ONCE, when its pen flips, and the change carries the
// report that names the restart. Rolling a lane back (removing it from `W2_PEN`)
// does NOT clear its row: the flipped-era acts it wrote still exist and still
// need pairing. A second flip after a rollback is a second era, and the honest
// shape for that is a list rather than a scalar — deliberately not built until
// a rollback actually happens, because a shape nobody needs is furniture.

// idiom as a finding handed up rather than a licence to add a fifth.
//
// THIS IS THE FIFTH, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT KIND. The other four are four spellings
// of the same credential; this is a SECOND credential, and the separation is the
// whole security property. `stance_reader` may see another household's draft
// (023_stance_reader.sql § the carve). `office_api` may not, and must not learn
// how — so the two cannot share a pool, and the env key that carries the second
// is read in exactly one place, here.
//
// WHY IT SITS BESIDE `actsQuery` RATHER THAN IN `world-stance.mjs`. The same
// reason the read ports borrow this pool: the office should learn the word
// "pool" once per table, not once per caller. Putting it here also means the one
// grep that finds every credential this office holds (`WORLD2_.*_URL` in
// `src/`) finds this one, which is not true of a pool opened in a door file.
//
// ── ABSENT IS `unreachable`, AND NEVER THE JOURNAL ──────────────────────────
//
// `actsQuery` returns `null` for "not asked" because its caller has a 1.0 arm to
// fall back to. THIS READ HAS NONE, by ruling: the sqlite arm is deleted from
// `worldForStances`, not flagged. So the absence of `WORLD2_STANCE_URL` is a
// state the door must SAY, not one it can paper over — a stance read that
// quietly answered "no candidates" because a credential was missing is the
// #2454 shape (a door showing a world in which the thing never happened), and
// here it would silently delete the-late-welcome on the first crossing.
//
// Hence a tagged answer rather than `null`: `{ unreachable: "<why>" }` or
