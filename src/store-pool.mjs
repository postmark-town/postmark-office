// store-pool.mjs — how every office pool on the store is built, and the one
// rule a held store connection keeps (POS-370).
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 2026-10-04, 16:52Z: switch 2 (TOWN_INDEX_READS=store) went live and the office
// stalled for about an hour. At 19:33Z nine `office_api` sessions sat "idle in
// transaction" for 81 and 48 minutes, every one last running the quest board's
// `town_quest_progress` read, with no lock waits and the CPU at 9%. Nine is
// three read workers times the pen's pool of three: every connection the office
// had was checked out, and every later index read waited for one forever.
//
// Nothing leaked in the sense of a missing release. The quest board read its
// progress row inside the pen's READ ONLY transaction and then, still holding
// it, asked the world whether the resident's home stands. With the kept
// positions on (WORLD_POSITIONS=1, WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2=1) that read rebuilds the
// positions projection once a minute, and the rebuild reads the clearing's
// snapshot through `officeRead`: a SECOND connection from the SAME pool of
// three. Three boards in one worker hold all three connections and wait on a
// rebuild that waits for a fourth. It never comes, and the rebuild is shared, so
// every standpoint read in that worker waits on it too.
//
// Three things here keep that from being able to stall the town again:
//
//   · ONE PEN CONNECTION PER CALL CHAIN. A call that holds a pen connection and
//     asks the pen for another is refused at once, by name (NestedStoreError),
//     instead of waiting for a connection its own chain is keeping busy. The
//     marker is an AsyncLocalStorage, so "the same chain" is exact: two requests
//     in flight are two chains, and a request's own awaited work is one.
//
//   · AN ACQUIRE TIMEOUT. A request that cannot get a connection fails in
//     WORLD2_PG_ACQUIRE_MS (default 10 s) with a sentence naming the pool, never
//     hangs. pg-pool's connectionTimeoutMillis bounds the wait in its queue as
//     well as the dial.
//
//   · THE SERVER ENDS AN IDLE TRANSACTION. Every pool asks for
//     idle_in_transaction_session_timeout (WORLD2_PG_IDLE_TX_MS, default 30 s)
//     as a startup parameter, so a transaction left open by any future mistake
//     is closed by Postgres and its connection comes back. DEPLOY.md § POS-370
//     sets the same on the roles, for every other client that logs in as them.
