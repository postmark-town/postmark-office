// events-store.mjs — THE CALENDAR'S PEN AND ITS READ (POS-207, POS-208).
//
// The rules are src/events.mjs's, pure. This file is where they meet the
// record: the queries, the transaction, the four household acts, the town's
// post / amend / close / advance for class "event" (POS-288), class "quest"
// (POS-294, the town's own posts; its rules are quests.mjs's) and class "bug"
// (Posts phase 2; its rules are bugs.mjs's), and the calendar read.
//
// ── ONE ACT, ONE TRANSACTION (the pen's R1, src/world2-pen.mjs) ─────────────
//
// Every write here is ONE `officeWrite` transaction: the store is read for
// what the act needs to know (the mark, the event), the act is inserted
// through the pen's own `insertAct`, and the row `applyPostAct` derives from
// that act is written to `posts` or `responses` on the same client. An
// announcement (POS-227) is the one act with no projection row: it is read back
// from `acts` itself (§ announcementsOf). A
// refusal thrown inside rolls the whole thing back, so a refused act leaves the
// acts count exactly where it was.
//
// The one thing done OUTSIDE a transaction is the webhook challenge (POS-208):
// a network call of up to ten seconds does not hold a transaction open. The
// event is read first, the challenge runs, and the write re-reads the event
// before it commits, so an event cancelled during the challenge is refused.
//
// ── THE REFUSAL, AND THE OTHER REFUSAL ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A rule's refusal (`{ code, defect, hint }`, events.mjs § refuse) passes
// through as itself. Anything else that goes wrong reaching or committing the
// record is the pen's ruled sentence — "the office's record cannot be reached
// — nothing was written, and nothing was lost" — as a 503, never a degrade
// (world2-pen.mjs § THE REFUSAL, D2).
