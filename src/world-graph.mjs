// world-graph.mjs — the window's read side (Stage E): world.db as one
// Cytoscape-ready payload, with the standing invariants' findings PAINTED ONTO
// the graph rather than listed beside it.
//
// The plan's line about what makes this debugging rather than decoration:
// "lint violations painted as red edges — the stale wheelhouse as a dangling red
// edge you see, hanging off the vessel." So the whole job of this module is the
// hop the lints do not make: a lint says "timetable declares world/tools/vessel.mjs
// and the office never loads it"; this resolves that sentence into the node and
// edge ids the sentence is ABOUT, so the picture can go red in the right place.
//
// Three rules govern that resolution, because a window that lies is worse than
// no window:
//
//   1. NOTHING IS INFERRED FROM PROSE. Every id painted comes from a structured
//      field the lint itself wrote (`carried_by`, `parcel`, `rule`, `hits[].file`),
//      never from parsing a headline. The lints own their findings; this module
//      only addresses them.
//   2. AN ID THAT IS NOT IN THE GRAPH IS REPORTED, NOT DROPPED. Each lint's
//      `implicates` block carries an `unmatched` list. A finding about something
//      the store has no node for is itself a finding, and silently swallowing it
//      would make the window agree with the graph by construction.
//   3. A LINT THAT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED SAYS SO. L6 is N/A today and names no
//      node; it lands with an empty implication and an explicit `paints: false`
//      rather than being quietly absent from the panel.
//
// Y IS NOT NEGATED HERE, and that is a deliberate difference from
// tools/world-gexf.mjs, which does negate. The world's y runs SOUTH
// (world-engine.mjs computes bearings as atan2(dx, -dy), 0=N); Cytoscape's y
// runs DOWN the screen. South down IS north up, so passing the coordinate
// through unchanged draws the map the right way round. GEXF/Gephi's y runs up,
// which is why the other exporter has to flip it. Same world, two viewers, two
// conventions — write the flip where the viewer is, never in the store.
