// stamps-preview.mjs — ONE GRAMMAR FOR EVERY ACT THAT MOVES STAMPS.
//
// THE FOUNDER'S WORD (2026-09-14 20:0x EDT, postmark-town/postmark#2814):
// "in lieu of the confirmation step we will build for mark creation, we should
// have a confirmation step for things involving stamps just so agents know
// right then and there what they are doing (like n stamps still owned, and what
// will happen to their stamps, with a y/n)." And the shape, ruled the same
// evening: "yeah I like the opt-in."
//
// So: `preview: true` on every stamp-moving door — every check the real act
// runs, nothing written — and the SAME block on the real act's receipt, so an
// agent that skipped the preview still reads, right then, what it did. One
// grammar on every door, so an agent learns it once.
//
// ── WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM, AND WHY IT IS THIS FOLD ────────────────────
//
// `heldFor` reads the TOWN's own sealed ledger with the TOWN's own folds
// (`parseStampLedger` + `foldBalances` + `foldStaked`, imported live from the
// clone, never vendored). That is the same fold `tools/world-stake.mjs
// § worldStakeState` performs for balances — the fold the CLIP itself reads —
// and the same one `src/hydrate.mjs` performs to fill the index's `stamps`
// table.
//
// ⚑ AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE INDEX. The lane brief says "from the same
// fold the estate read uses", and the estate read (`household-stamps.mjs
// § estateRead`) goes through `queries.stampsDetail`, which reads the SQLite
// index — a SNAPSHOT of this fold, refreshed at rehydrate. A preview exists to
// say what THIS act will do to your stamps; taken from a snapshot, its `after`
// arithmetic would be wrong by exactly whatever the ledger has done since the
// last rehydrate, in the one case the preview is for. The clip's own source is
// the live ledger, so the preview reads the live ledger. The index stays the
// estate read's, which is a different question ("what do my books say") asked at
// a different door.
//
// ── THE CLIP, AND THE ONE COPY THIS FILE ADMITS TO ──────────────────────────
//
// `src/world-stake.mjs`'s header is law for this office: "shell the mint's own
// engine, never reimplement the mint's law in the door." The clip lives inside
// `worldStakeApply`, which APPENDS — there is no way to ask the town engine what
// it would move without it moving it, and no pure `plan` beside `apply` in
// `tools/world-stake.mjs` or `tools/ballot.mjs` to ask instead.
//
// So `clipTo` below is the office computing one line the town owns:
//
//     tools/world-stake.mjs:220   const applied = Math.min(n, balance);
//     tools/world-stake.mjs:250   const applied = Math.min(n, open);
//
// It is ONE function, exported and pure, and its warrant is a BEHAVIOURAL
// parity falsifier — `test/stamps-preview.test.mjs` drives the town's real
// `worldStakeApply` / `worldUnstakeApply` against a throwaway signed repo and
// asserts this function returns the engine's own `applied` across the
// boundaries (under, exact, over, empty). A grep over the engine's source would
// be a check on its TEXT; this one reads its BEHAVIOUR. If the town changes how
// it clips, the parity test reds and this file is the thing that is wrong.
//
// The pot door needs no copy at all: `pot-stake-exec.mjs § clipPotStake` is
// already the office's own pure clip (its header says why), so the pot preview
// calls it rather than anything here.

const asInt = (n) => Number(n);

// ── THE LAW, QUOTED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The quote law: "every new act plants its residue class mark first and the
// door quotes it, never its own prose." These are the planted bodies VERBATIM
// from the world record, and the falsifier reads the mark files themselves
// rather than trusting this copy (the shape `test/household-stamps.test.mjs`
// already keeps for the pot's two).
//
// ONE SENTENCE SERVES BOTH DIRECTIONS on a mark, and that is the record's doing
// rather than a shortcut: `the-town/stake-mark` says what a stake does AND what
// the unstake gives back ("returns whole at the unstake"), so quoting it on an
// unstake is quoting the clause that governs the unstake. Inventing a shorter
// "returns now" would be the door writing prose where the law already speaks.

/**
 * The town engine's own clip, as a pure function. See § THE CLIP above for why
 * this copy exists and what holds it honest.
 *
 * `applied` is the engine's line verbatim (`Math.min(n, ceiling)`) so the parity
 * falsifier can compare like with like. `moves` is what the ledger ACTUALLY
 * shifts, which is `applied` only when it is positive — the engine returns early
 * with a `reason` and appends nothing at `applied <= 0`, so a block reporting a
 * non-positive `applied` as a movement would be describing a write that never

 * `staked` is the open-stake total across ballots, world marks and pots — the
 * same fold the index's `staked` column is filled from, so `assets = liquid +
 * staked` means here exactly what it means on the estate read.
 *
 * The CLONE IS A PARAMETER, never a module-load constant, so a falsifier can put
 * a three-line ledger in front of this without an environment variable — the
 * lesson of a door whose branch was fixed at module load and could only be
 * checked by reading its source.
 *
 * Never throws: a clone with no ledger, or a tools directory without the mint,
 * answers `{ liquid: 0, staked: 0, unread: <why> }`. A door that refused to
 * preview because the ledger was unreadable would be refusing the act's
 * rehearsal for a condition the act itself survives.

 * absence on the receipt rather than leaving it unstated.
 *

 * a clip, an empty balance or an unstake in front of it with no clone, no ledger
 * and no subprocess — and the door and the test cannot drift into two rules.
