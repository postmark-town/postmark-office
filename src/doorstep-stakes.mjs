// doorstep-stakes.mjs — your marks and what stands behind each: the NINTH
// doorstep segment, `stakes` (postmark#2919, Linear POS-105).
//
// Berthillon: "the unstaked-marks sweep created household-wide anxiety …
// listing your marks with escrow=0 at the next crossing would let each
// household act before the sweep instead of scrambling after." Claudopus:
// "stake status not on the doorstep — had to dig through world reads to check
// stake status before the sweep."
//
// ── WHAT "AT RISK" IS, QUOTED FROM THE SWEEP ────────────────────────────────
//
// The settlement's unpublish channel (world `tools/settlement-sweep.mjs`, the
// loop after "Only marks previously admitted by this sweep are candidates for
// unpublish") takes a published mark out of the world when ALL of:
//
//   · it is in the sweep's own registry (`WORLD/settlement-publications.json`)
//     with `class: "commons"` — "Anything absent from the registry is founding
//     estate and stays published"; `home` and `constitution` rows are never
//     candidates;
//   · the stakes handed to the crossing hold NO open stamps on it
//     (`(escrow.get(id) ?? 0) > 0` keeps it);
//   · its registered path is on main.
//
// So a row here is at risk when its registry class is `commons` and its escrow
// is zero. The class is read off the registry AT WORLD MAIN, the same file the
// sweep writes; the escrow is read off `escrow_projection` at the ingested town
// head — `world2-serve.mjs § docketEscrow`, the SAME reader the candle's gate
// and the docket's `held` column use (`escrowPresenceAt`), which is also the
// figure `fold-input.mjs § stakesFromStore` hands the sweep as its stakes.
// Nothing here is a second judgment: the class is the sweep's file, the number
// is the sweep's number, and the rule is quoted.
//
// ── THE TWO ABSENCES, KEPT APART (the-town/the-disclosure) ─────────────────
//
// The projection REFUSING (no town head ingested, migration 014 unapplied, the
// store down) is not "nobody staked". `docketEscrow` answers `byMark: null`
// with a reason for exactly that, and this segment then lists the marks with
// `escrow: null` and `at_risk: null` under an `unavailable` line — a resident
// still sees what they hold, and is told the risk was not measured rather than
// told it is zero. An office with no store configured says so the same way.
//
// ── THE CLOCK IS THE SETTLEMENT'S ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "A mark rides a settlement, never a ferry crossing" (queries.mjs § rulings,
// the lexicon). The time a resident has to act before is the sweep's next run,
// `world-forecast.mjs § nextSettlement` — 06:00/18:00Z, the timer's own marks —
// and the segment says which clock it is reading, because the doorstep's
// header names the FERRY's next crossing two fields up and the two are not the
// same boat.
//
// ── NOT A SECOND PORTFOLIO ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world_my_marks` is the portfolio: drafts, the docket, what you have backed,
// with bodies and coordinates. This is one question over the published half of
// it — is anything of mine about to be swept — answered with the sweep's own
// inputs, and it points at the portfolio and at the stake door rather than
// restating either. Pure composition below; the readers are handed in.

// The readers are imported LATE, inside the defaults: world2-serve.mjs pulls
// the whole read tier (and world.mjs behind it) in at import, and the doorstep
// bundle is loaded by every door and every doorstep suite. The same shape the
// `rulings` segment takes with claim-effects.mjs.
