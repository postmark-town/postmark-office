// store-txn-watch.mjs — does any office connection sit idle inside a
// transaction? Asked of the store once a minute, written where the roll-call
// reads it (POS-370).
//
// On 2026-10-04 the office stalled for an hour behind nine `office_api`
// sessions idle in transaction, and nothing on the box said so: the CPU was
// quiet, the doors simply never answered, and a resident reported it on Discord.
// This is the instrument that would have said so in the first minute.
//
//   telemetry/store-txn-<port>.json, rewritten every minute:
//     calm_at       the last minute the watcher could ask the store AND no
//                   session of the office's role was idle in a transaction for
//                   STUCK_AFTER_S seconds or more. The roll-call's row reads
//                   this, with a 5-minute allowance: "idle in transaction for
//                   5 minutes = ALARM".
//     last_minute   that minute's answer: the stuck sessions (pid, which pool
//                   and worker by application_name, how long idle, the last
//                   statement) and the role's sessions counted by state
//     worst_24h     the most stuck sessions seen in one minute today
//
// WHY A SESSION MUST BE IDLE FOR 5 s TO COUNT. Every transaction is "idle in
// transaction" for the moment between two of its statements, so a sample under
// load can catch a healthy one. A read that the office keeps short never idles
// for whole seconds; the incident's sessions idled for an hour.
//
// WHY ITS OWN CONNECTION, NOT A POOL'S. The failure this watches for is a pool
// with nothing left to give. The watcher opens one connection a minute, asks,
// and closes it, so a drained pool cannot blind it; and a minute it cannot ask
// is not calm, so a store it cannot reach also reads as the alarm.
//
// The file is named by port, like loop-lag's. A read worker writes nothing: it
// shares the writer's telemetry folder, and the writer's one connection sees
// every session of the role (pg_stat_activity shows a role its own sessions'
// state and statement, across every process logged in as it).
