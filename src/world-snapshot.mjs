// world-snapshot.mjs — READING A SEALED WORLD BACK, AND CHECKING IT (POS-357;
// 054_world_snapshots.sql).
//
// The clearing writes a snapshot as a pure SQL copy (world2/tools/world-snapshot-seal.mjs).
// This module is the other side: it reads a snapshot's rows back into the
// records `marksFromRows` already turns into the fold's input, and it checks a
// snapshot two ways, both read-only:
//
//   · checkSnapshot      the digests, recomputed here in JS from the stored rows:
//                        each version's digest is sha256 of its row, the list's
//                        digest is sha256 of its "<slug> <digest>" lines, and the
//                        header's digest is sha256 of the list digest, the
//                        three shas and the register digest (064). A second computation, never a writer: a
//                        hashing bug in the seal reds here.
//   · compareToStore     the snapshot against the store's standing rows NOW, by
//                        slug: a mark the store holds that the snapshot lacks is
//                        DROPPED, the reverse is EXTRA, the same slug with other
//                        bytes is CHANGED. Exact only while the store has not
//                        moved since the clearing: the review lane, marks-ingest
//                        and retire-unpublished all write `marks` between
//                        clearings, and the newest snapshot is the one this is
//                        asked of.
//
// The fold of a snapshot is the world's own `fold`, over `marksFromRows` of the
// rows read back here. There is no second fold and no second record shape:
// a version's row is the store row with the parent's slug in place of its
// uuid, so handing `marksFromRows` rows whose `id` IS the slug resolves every
// parent exactly as the store's uuids do.
