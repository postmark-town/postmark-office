// ── THE CLASS-MARK GATE (Stage 3, seam 1) ───────────────────────────────────
//
// An affordance is a VERB, and the only thing allowed to mint one is settled
// law: a mark authored by the town, at constitution tier, carrying a `class:`
// field. Resident prose can never mint a verb, however well-formed the
// frontmatter someone writes.
//
// The gate lives HERE, in the module that owns how the store is read, because
// it has two readers who must never disagree: the apex verb, which surfaces
// affordances at a standpoint (SQL, for the query planner), and lint L6, which
// checks that every exposed action has a handler (a predicate, over the loaded
// graph). Two copies of a security boundary is one copy too many; a test asserts
// the SQL and the predicate select the same nodes.
//
// `by = 'the-town'` is the clause that carries the weight. Tier is a word in
// somebody's frontmatter until authorship makes it a fact, and the write doors
// stamp `by` from the caller's own resident handles — the town is not a
// resident, so no credential at any door can author as it.
// THE POSITION CLAUSE (step-1 promotion, 2026-08-18; LOGOS/classes.md
// § Instantiation, ruled 2026-08-17: classes are declared "constitution-tier,
// standing in the Keeping Works"). Position is what tells a DECLARATION from
// an INSTANCE that happens to be town-authored — the three harbor charters
// carry `class: town` and declare nothing.
//
// ── RE-KEYED BY THE FREEZE, 2026-08-25 ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// This used to be the substring `/the-keeping-works/` in a mark's stored path,
// on the reasoning that "the marks tree nests a mark's directory under its
// parent's, so `/the-keeping-works/` in the path IS standing in the works". The
// freeze repealed the premise:
//
//   "Filing is frozen as of 2026-08-25. A mark's directory is its historical
//    filing: it carries no claim, and it never moves again. New marks are filed
//    by identity — WORLD/marks/<household>/<slug>/ — and containment lives only
//    in the derived fold, emitted as an artifact each settlement."
//                    (LOGOS/state-and-time.md § "The freeze", founder-ruled)
//
// A path test under that law is a QUIET failure, not a loud one: a class mark
// filed at `WORLD/marks/<by>/<slug>/` stands in the works by containment, fails
// the substring, and mints no verb — the door it declares simply is not there,
// with nothing refused and nothing logged.
//
// So position is now asked of containment. `world-hydrate.mjs` stamps
// `props.in_works` on every mark from the fold's own `WORLD/containment.json`
// chain, and this clause reads that stamp. The path arm survives as the FALLBACK
// for a store hydrated before the stamp existed — where the key is absent, and
// only there, the old substring answers. An explicit `false` refuses.
//
// One definition, taken by an alias so a joined query can spell it against its
// own table without a hand-copy. (The copy in world-classes.mjs was written out
// by hand precisely because this string carried a bare `props`; parameterising
// the alias is what lets that copy die.)
//
// ── AND IT CLOSES A DIVERGENCE THAT WAS NEVER ONLY A COPY ────────────────────

// mark-lint CLASS_ROSTER, same clause, same commit". That was false at the
// level that matters: the world's lint walked `_parentMarkId` ANCESTRY, while
// the office matched a PATH SUBSTRING. On the pre-freeze tree the two agreed
// because nesting and path were the same fact — so the divergence was invisible
// and would have surfaced only as a class mark that mints on one side of the
// town and not the other. Both now ask CONTAINMENT, which is one mechanism
// rather than two that happen to coincide.
