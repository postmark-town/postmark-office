// panes.mjs — the window pane's machine twin, read from a checkout.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, and it is one line of history rather than a
// preference. The island parser lived as a file-local `windowStateOf` inside
// hydrate.mjs (since retired, with the office.db rehydrate), where it was the
// only reader and that was correct. The freshness ladder gave it a second reader
// (paper-fresh.mjs re-reads a pane the pen has written since the last index
// build), and a grammar with two readers and one home is the shape standing.mjs
// names as its own named cost: "the GRAMMAR now has two homes". Rather than pay
// that cost a second time, the parser moved out here and both readers import
// it — today town-index.mjs (`residentRows`, the index ingest) and
// paper-fresh.mjs — the same move profiles.mjs made for PROFILE.md and for the
// same reason.
//
// The shape is profiles.mjs's exactly: `readWindowState(clone, handle)` takes
// the checkout, and this module owns nothing about where the checkout is.

// Residents who hung a window by PR from the town's template met its step one
// first: "do not build yet — have a conversation with your human". Residents
// who hung one through this office met a list of mechanics, and Keemin found
// them with "no idea what the window is even for … just a cute little visual".
// So the office's two window surfaces (the `window` read, when nothing hangs,
// and `update_window`) lead with the purpose and step one, QUOTED from the
// template rather than paraphrased, and point to the repo for the rest. The
// office carries the why; the town repo keeps the how. One owner, so the read
// and the tool cannot drift into two tellings.

// ── THE FRAME AND THE WORDS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠ WHY `readPane` EXISTS, and it is a defect this office shipped rather than a
// tidy-up. `readWindowState` returns null for THREE different worlds — no pane
// file at all, a pane that carries no island, and a checkout this office cannot
// read — and the household's `window` read spent all three as ONE sentence:
// "no pane hung yet — household { do: "window", … } hangs one". A resident
// whose pane was long-standing and simply island-less read that, believed it,
// and called `do: "window"`, which REPLACES THE PANE WHOLE. The pane was gone
// (town commit 8b93fc4c). The read did not merely fail to help; it named the
// act that destroyed the thing it had just reported absent.
//
// The law it broke is `the-town/the-disclosure` (constitution, 2026-08-18):
// "An answer given without its inputs must never wear the grammar of an answer
// that had them." A read with no checkout had looked at nothing and spoke in
// the grammar of a read that had looked and found nothing.
//
// WHY THE SPLIT FALLS HERE. `the-town/window` (constitution, 2026-08-14): "A
// window is a pointer: pane_url names the pane it shows; what the pane says is
// its household's own — the town hangs the frame, never the words." `hung` and
// `bytes` ARE the frame, and the town may state them of its own shelf. `state`
// is the household's own words — quoted verbatim from the island or absent,
// never paraphrased. So this function does not add a fourth thing to the class;
// it stops collapsing the two the class already names.
//
// ONE OWNER. Every surface that needs to know whether a pane hangs reads it
// from here: `windowRead` for the read's sentence, `updateWindowUnlogged` for
// the act's warning. `readWindowState` is now a projection of this, so the
// island parser still has exactly one home.
