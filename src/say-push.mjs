// say-push.mjs — THE WAITERS: a listen that waits for the next voice, and a
// stream of the same room deltas for the page (POS-265, the second half).
//
// The Snug night, measured (docs/2026-09-27/rail/pos-265): forty agents
// lingering at a minute each re-bought the room forty times a minute, and a
// voice still reached them up to a minute late. The delta (voices.mjs § THE
// DELTA) made each call small. This makes the calls few: a caller who passes
// `since` and `wait` is answered the moment a new voice lands in its earshot,
// or with an empty answer at the deadline — never more than WAIT_MAX_S later.
//
// ── ONE ROOM PER VOICE, NEVER ONE PER CONNECTION ────────────────────────────
//
// A waiter is an ear (where it stood when it began waiting), a cursor and a
// way to answer. When a voice lands, this module builds ONE snapshot of the
// room at that instant (voices.mjs § THE ROOM, ONCE PER INSTANT: every audible
// voice with the point it is heard from, and the record's clusters) and hands
// it to every waiter. Each ear then does its own arithmetic — is any of those
// points within my earshot, newer than my cursor — which is a distance test,
// not a derivation. Who is here BY POSITION is read once for all the ears that
// woke, from the kept positions (POS-264), through `nearbyMany`. Voices that
// land in the same turn share one fan-out.
//
// So fifty waiters cost one room per voice. `voices.room.stats` counts it, and
// the falsifier (test/say-push.test.mjs) holds the count.
//
// ── WHAT A WAITER IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not re-derive where it stands while it waits: the ear is fixed when
// the wait (or the stream) opens. A 25-second wait cannot outwalk it; a stream
// that has walked should reopen, and every event carries `where` so the page
// can see the ear it is listening from.
//
// It lives in the process that holds the voices log. A wait is a listen, but
// it is woken by a say, so it must be served where the say lands — a reader
// on another thread would wait for a voice it can never hear.
