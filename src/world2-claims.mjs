// inserts a PENDING claim into the public docket — "here is everything that

// retraction stays free until then (claims_update_guard, 002_grants.sql).

// the shadow era the sketchbook drain is still 1.0's truth; the docket is the
// lane being proven. Same serialized fire-and-forget queue, loud on failure.

//
// 001_tables.sql says what this column holds: "denormalized at submit from
// identities". This pen was writing the journal's own `household` field, which is
// a bare resident handle (`darko`) — so one column carried three spellings of one
// fact: `gh:<id>` from the seed, NULL where the seed found no roster line, and a
// bare handle from here.
//
// Wright's ruling, 2026-08-28: adopt 1.0's spelling. A roster owner keeps the
// household KEY; a non-roster owner is `solo:<handle>`, never NULL. That is the
// fold's `declared_household` rule verbatim — `households[handle] ?? solo:<handle>`
// (marks-fold.mjs § the household grain) — and `identities` is the projection of
// the very file the fold reads, so asking it here gives the register and the
// docket one answer.
//
// ONLY POSITIVE ANSWERS ARE CACHED, deliberately. A handle that has a household
// key does not lose it, so caching that is safe. A MISS is the registry-lag case
// the fold's own comment describes — "registry lag never blocks a new resident, it
// only leaves them ungrouped until the town knows them" — and it resolves the
// moment law_ingester projects the new roster line. Caching the miss would keep
// writing `solo:` for a resident the town had already learned, for as long as the
// office stayed up.

/**
 * THE ONE RESOLVER, called by BOTH halves of the private-draft lane.
 *
 * The write path resolves the household from the journal row's `household`
 * (which is the office key's household name); `/world2/my-drafts` resolves it
 * from the same key. If those two ever spelled the household differently, a
 * resident would save a draft and then be told they have none — the row policy
 * would be working perfectly and the answer would still be wrong. Routing both
 * through this function is what makes that unrepresentable, so do not inline
 * either half.
 *
 * ── "THE TWO NETS ARE ONE NET" — ASKED AND ANSWERED (2026-09-07) ───────────
 *
 * Lane A observed that the WHERE clause in `pgLiveMarks` and 007's row policy
 * both key off this function's output, so a wrong row in `identities` defeats
 * both at once and there is no independent check. That observation is true and
 * it is ACCEPTED DESIGN, not a defect to file — written down here rather than
 * opened as an issue, on the reviewer's reading, which is the better one:
 *
 *   the IDENTITY is one fact, and the two mechanisms enforce two different
 *   things over it. The WHERE clause bounds the result set; the row policy
 *   bounds what the credential may return AT ALL — and only the second survives
 *   a new reading surface written by somebody who did not know it was needed.
 *   That is exactly 007's own argument for the policy ("enforced structurally,
 *   not by vigilance"), and it is why the two are not redundant.
 *
 * A wrong row in `identities` does defeat both. It also defeats every other
 * notion of who you are in this town, which is what makes this function's
 * single-resolver discipline the right shape rather than a shared weakness:
 * one fact, one place to be wrong, one place to fix.

 * public docket has carried — so the crossing's own account keeps it, under
 * `sixCount.retracted_before_close` (clearing-job.mjs § 6).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A FUNCTION AND NOT TWO STATEMENTS ──────────────────────────
 *
 * Its callers ask for the same thing from opposite ends. `claimTxFromJournal`
 * retracts because a resident withdrew a claim that had stood publicly; the
 * stake door (world-stake.mjs § A STAKE THAT HOLDS NOTHING IS NEVER FILED)
 * retracts a promotion it made moments earlier and is about to refuse. Two
 * statements would be two notions of what retraction writes, and the second one
 * written would be the one that forgot `decided_at` — which is the column the
 * candle's own tally reads nothing of but every receipt beside it does.
 *
 * KEYED ON (window, slug, claimant) rather than on the claim's id, because that
 * is the key the withdraw arm has in hand: it is holding a journal row, not a
 * row id. The stake door has both and passes these three.
 *
 * `q` is a CLIENT when the caller holds a transaction (the withdraw arm rides
 * the pen's own), and null when it does not (the stake door, which has already
 * committed its promotion). The row policy takes no household declaration for
 * this write — `claims_update_office` is `USING (status <> 'draft' OR …)` and a
 * pending row satisfies the first arm — so the pool is a lawful place to run it.

 * A later `world_stake` on a draft: the boundary act, arriving on its own.
 *
 * The ruling's plainest case -- you composed something, slept on it, and now
 * you back it. Staking is submitting, so this is the whole of what the stake
 * door has to do about the docket.
 *
 * ONE STATEMENT DOES THE PROMOTION AND THE STRIP, and that shape was taught by
 * the transition guard rather than chosen: a second `UPDATE ... SET data = data
 * - '_deferred_act'` on the now-PENDING row is not one of the four transitions
 * 007 permits, so it raised — after the promotion had already committed and the
 * act had already been mirrored. The guard was right and the code was wrong.
 * Reading the held act BEFORE the update and stripping it IN the update leaves
 * nothing for a second write to do.
 *
 * THE MIRROR RUNS INSIDE THE TRANSACTION NOW (R1, ruled and rebuilt
 * 2026-08-29). The old shape — `mirrorAct` after the COMMIT, on its own pool
 * and queue — was correct for two independent pens and became the design's
 * named atomicity hole F3: a promotion that commits and then fails to mirror
 * leaves a PENDING CLAIM WITH NO DEED on the public docket. The old deadlock
 * argument dissolved with the plumbing: `insertAct` takes THIS transaction's
 * own client, so there is no second pool to wait on. The act and the
 * promotion now commit together or not at all.
 *
 * THE ACT IS DATED AT THE PUTTING-FORWARD, not at the composing. The world
 * witnessed a resident put this mark forward; it did not witness them thinking
 * about it. Back-dating would also aim the row at a window the notary may have
 * frozen already — an append-only archive refusing a late arrival, which is the
 * repo catching the office rewriting history, correctly, over something that
 * would have been our own doing.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ROW DOES NOT SAY WHAT IT HOLDS (ruled 2026-09-12) ─────────────
 *
 * `stake` is the number ASKED. It has to be: this statement runs BEFORE the
 * stamp ledger, by the order the stake door's own comment argues for. So a
 * claim whose escrow move applied less than it asked carries a `stake` figure
 * that reads exactly like a backed claim — which is #2686, nine hours of
 * `stake: 1` behind a mark holding zero.
 *

 * `claims_update_guard` permits an office pen four transitions of which
 * `pending -> pending` is not one. The guard stays as it is (Keemin, 09-12): no
 * fifth transition, no migration.
 *
 * So the docket DERIVES it instead. `escrow_projection` (014) already holds the
 * open position per (mark, holder) as-of a town sha, and the candle's own gate
 * already reads it — `escrowPresenceAt` in world2/tools/escrow-presence.mjs.
 * world2-serve.mjs § THE DOCKET ROW asks that same reader, so the docket and
 * the gate it forecasts cannot disagree, no claim is ever rewritten, and a later
 * unstake shows up on the next read rather than leaving a stale snapshot behind.
 *
 * Returns { promoted, claim, window }. `promoted: false` is the ordinary answer
 * for a stake on an already-public mark, and never an error. `window` is the
 * candle the claim joined, which is the key its retraction is written against.

 * compare 1.0's finished journal against a docket still being written, and the
 * diff would be timing."* It then did exactly that — G1_a/G2_a/G4_a

 * guards-alfa/the-quiet-shed and the port does not — a slug-collision guard
 * reading the port would PERMIT a duplicate."* Nothing was wrong with the port.
 *
 * FIXED HERE RATHER THAN AT THE CALL SITE, because the call site was not wrong:
 * it asked the honest question and got a false receipt. `settleShadowPens`
 * survived only by awaiting all three queues by hand, and nothing marked the
 * difference between the caller that happened to be safe and the one that was
 * not. A function named for the docket that knows only about a queue the docket
 * abandoned is the states-with-no-receipt class, wearing a receipt's coat.
 *

 * keeping it costs one already-resolved promise — where dropping it would mean
 * this answer silently stops covering anything that enqueues here again.

 * reads the newest and reports the rest as history.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT SCOPED TO ONE HOUSEHOLD, AND WHY THAT IS LAWFUL ────────
 *
 * The docket is PUBLIC — 007_private_drafts.sql's row policy says so in one

 * So a receipt on somebody else's pending claim is a public fact this door is
 * allowed to answer, and a receipt on their DRAFT is unrepresentable — not by a
 * WHERE clause here, but structurally, because `current_setting(…, true)`
 * answers NULL when nothing declared and NULL is never equal to anything.
 *
 * `household` is therefore the CALLER's, and it buys exactly one thing: the
 * caller's own drafts. Handed null, the read runs with nothing declared and the
 * policy hides every draft in town, the caller's included — which is the right
 * answer for a spectator and the reason this takes the argument rather than
 * resolving a key it was not given.
 *
 * ⚑ THE SET-LOCAL TRAP is `withHousehold`'s, and it is documented there: this
 * runs on a POOL, so `app.household` must never outlive its transaction. Do not
 * inline the declaration here.
