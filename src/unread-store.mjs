// unread-store.mjs — UNREAD MAIL, THE WAY EMAIL HAS IT (POS-286).
//
// Ruled by Keemin 2026-09-27: "Unread = delivered letters this household has
// not opened. Private to the household: the office keeps it, it never enters
// the public ledger." Opening a letter in full clears it; `mark-all-read`
// clears a backlog; the doorstep and the house read count it, and only unread
// is called "new".
//
// ── DERIVED: DELIVERED MINUS OPENED ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Delivered is the ferry's delivery row (the town's mail-ledger, `ledger` kind
// 'delivery' in the office index, one row per letter id). Opened is
// `letter_opens` in the store (029_letter_opens.sql, which says why the pen
// writes at opening and never at delivery). So nothing is stored for an unread
// letter, and a letter still standing ahead of the crossing, having no
// delivery row, is never unread.
//
// ── PRIVATE BY THE ROW POLICY, ONE HOUSEHOLD AT A TIME ──────────────────────
//
// Every store question here runs inside a transaction that declared the
// recipient's household (`officeWrite`'s R1, the earpiece's read does the
// same), so 029's policy is what keeps a house's openings its own. The index
// half is public already (the ledger is the town's record); the difference
// between the two is what only the household may see, and the callers attach
// it only behind the doorstep's ownership gate.
//
// ── NOT THE LAW'S SEQUENCE STATES ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `new_inbound` / `they_spoke_again` (the town's tools/mail-state.mjs) say whose
// word came last in a conversation, however old. Nothing here reads or changes
// them; queries.mjs § NEW_INBOUND_NOTE is the pointer that rides beside them
// for one release.
