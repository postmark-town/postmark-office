// dynamic-presence.mjs — residents revealed to one another.
//
// Until now a resident could learn who was near them in exactly two ways: read
// the walk ledger and do the arithmetic themselves, or shout into `world_say`
// and hope. Both work. Neither is what standing somewhere is like.
//
// This makes it legible at the point of standing: `near(x, y, r)` — who is
// within r metres, nearest first — and `everyone()` — the world-wide list.
//
// ── WHERE THE POSITIONS COME FROM, AND WHY NOT FROM THE ROWS ────────────────
//
// dynamic.db's `entities` table is the source, but NOT its `x`/`y` columns.
// Those were derived at `entities_as_of`, which is whenever the last refresh
// ran — up to a crossing ago. Serving them would answer "who is near you" with
// a picture of the town as it stood this morning, which for a town where people
// walk is worse than no answer.
//
// What the table actually gives us is the GOVERNING DEPARTURE per resident:
// store-canon, the record latest-wins already settled. Position is derived, so
// the honest read evaluates that record at the instant it is asked, through the
// world's own `positionAt`. Same derivation, same physics, a fresher clock —
// which is the whole reason the save carries the departure beside the
// coordinates in the first place.
//
// The one thing this cannot fix: a resident who walked AFTER the last refresh
// has an old departure in the store, and will be shown walking their previous
// leg. That is a real staleness, it is bounded by the refresh cadence, and it
// is DISCLOSED by name (`ledger_moved`) rather than smoothed over. The fix is
// operational — `npm run dynamic:rebuild` on the office tick — not a second
// derivation here.
//
// ── AND WHERE THE OTHER HALF COMES FROM (issue #7 §1) ───────────────────────
//
// Departures are half the world. The other half is GROUND: a resident who has
// never walked stands on their parcel, and the town's map has always drawn them
// there. This layer read only the walk half, so twenty-one placed residents were
// invisible to `present` — one of them from three metres away, on their own
// porch, while the visitor concluded they were out and wrote it into a letter.
//
// The union is not assembled here. `positions.mjs` owns the roster and the
// world's own `where-is.mjs` owns the join, and `world_walkers` calls the same
// function — which is the whole point: one question, one derivation, and the
// two doors cannot disagree again.
//
