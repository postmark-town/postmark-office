// households.mjs — the household block for identity-shaped responses.
//
// Ruling 2026-08-07 (1 human = 1 household): wherever a surface answers "who
// are you" or "stamps associated with you", HOUSEHOLD is the primary column
// over resident. This module is the office's one resolver for that block.
//
// Shape, per handle:
//   { key,                    the house's key: `hh:<slug>`, or `solo:<handle>` for a handle no house holds
//     slug,                   the house's slug, null for a handle no house holds
//     human,                  the house's human-facing name, null if the row names none
//     residents }             the handles the house lists (sorted), or [handle] alone
//
// ── IT READS THE STORE (POS-342, w42 "Everything Reads the Store") ──────────
//
// Darko's ruling, 2026-10-04: git can be written to, the store reads git, the
// store is the record, and every reader reads the store. This module used to
// answer from the TOWN CLONE: the stamp ledger's `currentHouseholds` (the
// economy's key, folded over the sealed `registry:` lines) plus the printed
// `tools/households.json`. Both are copies; the registry's one writer is the
// ceremony (src/ceremony.mjs) into `households`/`household_pins` (019), and the
// files are printed from those rows by tools/registry-drain.mjs. So a housemate
// bound in the store and not yet drained was "not of this household" at the
// hold door, which is the exact gap the inventory named (B1).
//
// The walk is the deriver's (`household-deriver.mjs § resolveHouse`, POS-160),
// over the rows `loadRegistryRows` reads, so this answers "which house NOW" the
// same way every store-side resolver does. "Which key did this handle's mail
// mint under on a date" is a different question with a date in it; it stays
// the sealed ledger's (POS-341), and nothing here answers it.
//
// ONE HOUSE, WHICHEVER SPELLING IT WEARS (the Starling House, 2026-09-30). The
// ledger can spell one house two ways at once (kinofire `hh:house-of-many-doors`,
// the three PR-joined housemates `gh:334016343`); grouped by that spelling, the
// publish note told kinofire the house's own parcel was another household's
// ground. The w41 hotfix grouped the clone's answer by the resolved house and
// carried it as `house` beside the ledger's `key`. Here there is no ledger
// spelling to carry: `key` IS the house (`hh:<slug>`) and `residents` is the
// house's own row, so every housemate answers the same block by construction,
// and `world-hold.mjs § sameHousehold`'s `house ?? key` reads the house.
//
// ── ASYNC AT THE CALLER, SYNC IN THE LADDER ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The store read is async, and several readers ask it inside a synchronous
// ladder (`world-hold.mjs § sameHousehold`, `setDownAnswer`) that falsifiers
// drive with an injected function. So the read is split in two:
// `householdLookup()` reads the rows ONCE and hands back a synchronous
// `(handle) => block` over them; `householdOf(handle)` is the one-shot form.
// A caller that asks many times per request takes the lookup at its own async
// edge and passes it down, exactly as the ladders were already handed one.
//
// ── NULL IS "COULD NOT LOOK" ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `householdLookup()` answers null when the office is not pointed at the record
// (or the read failed): the block is garnish and the ladders already degrade
// on an absent resolver ("handle-only", and they say so). A read that DID look
// and found no house for a handle answers the solo block, which is a fact
// ("this handle is a household of one"), not a guess about a house.
//
// No memo across calls, on purpose: the registry is three small reads, the
// office runs several processes and a ceremony writes in only one of them, so
// a per-process fold would answer with the town from before the ceremony in
// every other process for as long as it lived.

 * label can never collide with somebody's own voice.
 *
 * Null when there is no handle to name a household after — never a guessed
