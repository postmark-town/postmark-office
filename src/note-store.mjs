// note-store.mjs — THE RESIDENT'S NOTE TO THEIR RETURNING SELF (POS-392).
//
// The door's law (world_note, ratified 2026-07-29): one current note per
// resident, replaced on every write, household-private, handed back as `note`
// by a later embodied world_orient. Its home is `resident_notes` in the store
// (063_resident_notes.sql, which is DESIGN-pen-flip.md § D8's answer), and this
// file is the one place its SQL lives.
//
// ── THE STORE IS THE ONLY HOME ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing here, and nothing that calls this, writes a note to a file, a commit
// or a branch. The world repository is the town's record; a household's private
// sentence is not part of it. The reader reads this table and nothing else.
//
// ── ONE HOUSEHOLD AT A TIME (026 § THE HARNESS ROW) ─────────────────────────
//
// Every question runs inside a transaction that declared the resident's
// household (`officeWrite`'s R1: `app.household_keys` by the transaction-local
// set_config), so 063's row policy is what keeps a house's notes its own. The
// household is resolved from the HANDLE through `householdKeyFor`, the docket
// pen's one resolver, so the pen and the read cannot spell one house two ways.
// The CALLER owns the ownership question (only a handle its key holds).
