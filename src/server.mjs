// what fixed `hold-wirings` WIRING 1. But it is exactly the wrong shape for a
// MISCONFIGURED PROCESS, and the two were being answered by one mechanism.
//
// Driven, two workers side by side, one pointed at the real store and one at a
// path that does not exist: BOTH boot and BOTH answer 200, and the misconfigured
// one silently drops a whole derived block where its twin has an answer. Behind
// nginx that is a pool member serving quietly wrong readings to a share of the
// town, and nothing in the answer says so.
//
// ⚑ THE SYMPTOM THAT DROVE THIS GUARD HAS MOVED, AND THE GUARD HAS NOT.
// `stands` was the block measured going dark, and POS-162 moved it off this
// store onto `acts` — so a worker pointed at a missing `dynamic.db` now answers
// `stands` correctly and drops OTHER readings instead (world-hold.mjs §
// readHoldEffects' hold events, the apex's held-things and arena reads). The
// rule this guard states is unchanged and so is its exit code; only the example
// is restated, because a guard whose named symptom has stopped being true reads
// as a guard nobody has checked.
//
// So the guard goes UPSTREAM, at boot, beside the key store's — because the
// distinction that matters is not "is the store there" but WHOSE MISTAKE ITS
// ABSENCE IS. Absent at a read, mid-flight, is the world's news and the reader
// reports it. Absent at boot, when an operator named the path, is the
// operator's, and a process that cannot see the store it was pointed at must
// not take traffic. Same rule as `oauth.db` directly above; same exit code.
// ⚑ THE READERS' OWN FUNCTION, NOT A SECOND COPY OF THE RULE (reviewer's
// repair B, lap 5). This line was `process.env.WORLD_DYNAMIC_DB ?? resolve(ROOT,
// "dynamic.db")` — the same rule as `dynamicDbPath()` spelled a second time from
// a different root (`ROOT` here is `resolve(HERE, "..")`; the readers' is
// `OFFICE_ROOT`, `resolve(import.meta.dirname, "..")` in world-store.mjs). They
// resolve to the same string today, which is exactly what makes a second copy
// dangerous: it agrees until it doesn't, and the failure it produces is a guard
// that PASSES on a path the readers never open — a boot check policing the
// wrong file while the workers serve a null block. A guard must ask the
// question in the words of the thing it guards.

// ── the index, and how it is replaced under a running office ─────────────────
//
// office.db is REBUILT every tick: hydrate writes `office.db.new` and the tick
// renames it over this path. Until 2026-08-11 the tick then ran `systemctl
// restart postmark-office`, because the boot-time handle WAS the data — the
// restart was the reload. It also killed every live MCP session on the
// quarter-hour. So the handle is swapped in place instead, and a restart goes
// back to meaning the only thing it should mean: new code.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. The replacement is opened and its `meta` read
// BEFORE anything is swapped, so a half-written file, a non-database, or an
// index with no meta table leaves the office serving exactly what it was
// serving a moment ago — one line on stderr, and another look on the next poll.
//
// node:sqlite is synchronous, so no statement is ever in flight ACROSS the
// swap. What can outlive it is a request that took the handle as an argument
// and then awaited something slow — `handleOauth` holds one across a GitHub
// round trip — so a retired index is kept open until its last borrower has
// answered, not merely until a timer says probably.

// THE TOWN ROLL, from the office's own reader — never a second resolver.
// `residentList` is the roll `/residents` and `list_residents` are both cut
// from — since 2026-09-10 each of them serves it through `residentPage`, which
// bounds and counts it but never changes what is true —
// so the roll the position doors ask about is the same roll the town publishes.
// One named function because three doors need it, and a roll that differed
// between them would be the split-brain positions.mjs exists to prevent.
// Answers `null`, never a silent `[]`: the doors disclose an absent roll
// (`the-town/the-disclosure`), and they cannot disclose what looks like an
// empty town.
// ── MEMOISED ON THE INDEX'S OWN STAMP (2026-08-29, the party) ────────────────
//
// `residentList` was ~11% of a saturated event loop under the party's load: the
// whole roll re-read and re-mapped on every position door, for every guest, and
// it is the same roll for all of them. Keyed on `stampOf()` — (ino, mtime,
// size) — which is exactly what already tells this file that the index has been
// swapped. So the roll is recomputed when the record changes and not once more
// than that; the memo cannot go stale without the stamp saying so.

// the doors must keep being able to disclose an absent roll rather than an
// empty town.

  // and has no default, so the bare call is `statSync(undefined)`, which throws,
