// world-lints.mjs — the eight standing invariants of the town, run as queries
// over the Graphology runtime at the end of every hydration and written into
// lint_findings, where the delta between runs is the alert surface.
//
// The questions are not this file's to invent, and §2.10 — which this header
// pointed at, for six of them — resolves to nothing: WORLD/ENGINE.md carries
// no numbered sections at all. They are constitutional marks now: the
// postmark-invariant family under
// WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/the-town-centre/the-keeping-works/, one class
// per invariant, each carrying dials {"lint": "Lx"}, a one-claim body, and a
// mechanic child naming THIS module. The family's own words:
//
//   "The standing questions: each invariant is a class here, its mechanic
//    naming the code that asks it — a question no code asks is not being asked."
//
// and the abstraction they instantiate, logos/the-invariant:
//
//   "An invariant is a standing question the town asks of itself at every fold
//    — it reports, never repairs, and names its method and its limits."
//
// So every finding here CITES the law it enforces: `law` is the mark id,
// `law_text` is that mark's one claim VERBATIM. A finding that quotes its law
// can be held against the law; a finding that quotes a section number cannot.
// L0 keeps the citation honest — it reads the eight marks' own dials off the
// world tree and goes RED on a drifted pairing rather than skipping quietly.
// As of 2026-08-23 the last §2.10 pointers are gone from the store, the
// hydrator and this file: each is re-anchored to the invariant it was really
// reaching for. This header's own mention above is the record of what they said.
//
//   node src/world-lints.mjs            # human report, from the built store
//   node src/world-lints.mjs --json     # machine rows
//
// The rule that shapes this file, same as the hydrator's: a lint REPORTS, it
// never repairs, and it never launders a red into a green by narrowing its own
// question. Each states the METHOD that produced its verdict, the LIMITS of
// that method, and evidence a human can go check. A lint that hides its noise
// floor is a lint nobody can trust.
//
// L2 is the one that changed at Stage 1, and it is the reason geometry_versions
// exists: it judges each departure against the stop geometry OF THAT INSTANT,
// not against today's. The spike watched a re-siting turn a 22 m near-miss into
// a 1238 m gross error without anything about the departure changing — a lint
// that re-decides history every time the world is rearranged is a lint that
// will read more and more of the past as broken.

    // names it, or whether the mark says out loud that nothing does yet. A

DIAL -> CODE: every constitutional mark standing in the Keeping Works is walked for the values it declares (\`dials:\` entries and a predicate's own \`slot\`/\`value\`; numbers and booleans, never strings), and each is looked for BY NAME in the same source set — a dial is reached by name, so the name is the join.

The narrowing is named rather than hidden, and the list grows by being edited — the CONSTS table above is the whole of it. THE DIAL->CODE HALF IS NOT CLOSED (added 2026-08-30, after an audit found four separate instances the closed list could not see): it walks every value-carrying constitutional node in the Works, so it is open by construction and grows with the record. Its own limits are the ones that matter now, and they are three. It matches on NAMES, so a module constant that merely shares a dial's name reads as a reader — `the-town/sound`'s four dials are derived from `say`'s in src/dynamic-store.mjs rather than read off the mark, and this half cannot tell those apart. It cannot see WHERE a name is read, so 'read by the engine' here means 'named somewhere in the running source', not 'read at its declared home' — a dial reached through `dialNumber` and one hardcoded beside a comment mentioning it look identical. And it rules only on numbers and booleans: `unsealed` and the pointer form (`\"the-town/resident\"`) are the record's two ways of saying the value is not here, and asking whether the engine reads a signpost would report every correctly-delegated dial as an orphan. A flagged dial is taken at its word — the mark saying nothing reads it is accepted as true, which makes the flag a promise a human has to keep, not a fact this lint verified. Within the three watched constants: a text scan with no context, so HTTP status 405 is matched by the pace-405 watch and the parcel dial 25 matches every unrelated 25. Every row carries its source line for adjudication. Structurally: the store has NO code->mark edge type, so absolution by 'reads the owning mark' can only fire on a file that quotes a mark's path literally — which no file does today. And since Stage 1 moved the lints into office/src, this module's own watch list is inside the scanned corpus and counts as an orphan of every constant it watches (rows marked is_watchlist) — true by the lint's own definition, and left in rather than exempted.

  // WRITTEN 2026-08-09, the day the apex verb shipped (Stage 3). Until then this
  // reported N/A over an empty action set, on the ground that a conformance
  // check with nothing to check is not green, it is unrun. There is now
  // something to check.
  //
  // The question: a class mark that passes the gate ADVERTISES its actions to
  // every resident standing near it. If the office has no handler for one, law
  // has opened a door with no room behind it — and the resident finds out by
  // reaching for it. So the exposed set comes from the STORE (the marks, which
  // are what residents actually see) and the handled set comes from the apex's
  // own dispatch table (the code that actually runs), and they must agree.
  //
  // Both sides read their single source: `isClassMark` is the same gate the
  // apex queries with, and `DISPATCHABLE` is the key set of the table the door
  // dispatches on. Nothing here restates either.
