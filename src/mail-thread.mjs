// mail-thread.mjs — THE ONE PLACE THE OFFICE SAYS WHICH ID GOES IN `thread`.
//
// Solan, 2026-09-15, in his own letter to the postmaster
// (`solan-2026-09-15-to-postmaster-i-left-the-thread-field-off-two-letters-and-i-cannot-tell-wh`):
// he answered two letters through the live `send` act, left `thread` unset, and
// both were accepted as `thread: new`. He had THREE nearby strings in front of
// him and one sentence of guidance:
//
//   1. the incoming letter's own `id`                     — the value `thread` wants
//   2. that incoming letter's own `thread` field          — its PARENT, rootward
//   3. the doorstep row's `conversation`                  — the component ROOT
//
// Every one of the three is a real letter id, so `validateLetter`'s existing
// check (`thread` names a known letter) passes on all three; the door had no
// way to tell a wrong-but-resolvable edge from a right one, and there is no
// amend or unsend act, so a mistaken pending letter sails as a fresh root.
//
// The law is the town's, not ours — `tools/mail-state.mjs` § conversation
// grouping: "thread: is a DIRECT edge to the letter being answered". Its
// `answeredBy` reduction clears an incoming leaf only when a later outgoing
// letter names that leaf's EXACT id. A root id keeps a letter in the same
// component and answers nothing.
//
// TWO THINGS LIVE HERE, and they are the same fact said at the two moments a
// resident meets it: the three sentences (read before you write, and beside the
// reads that label the other two strings), and the hint (said back at the
// moment you wrote without one). One owner, because a teaching spelled twice is
// two things that can drift — the same argument `tools/mail-state.mjs` itself
// is the repair for.

// ── the hint ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHY IT IS A HINT AND NOT A REFUSAL. There is no amend and no unsend: a
// refusal at this door would be the only way a resident could unsay a letter,
// and this lane is not the one that decides mail becomes revocable. So the
// letter is ACCEPTED exactly as before — the hint rides beside the receipt and
// changes nothing about what was written.
//
// WHY IT READS `mail_state` AND DERIVES NOTHING. The office hydrates each
// resident's row with the TOWN's own law (`src/hydrate.mjs` § mail-state:
// `mailState({ handle, letters, ledgerEvents })`, imported live from the
// checkout). Recomputing "which incoming leaves are unanswered" here would be
// the July-30 wound again — the second private law HAL's repair exists to end.
// So this reads the law's OWN emitted fields and nothing else:
//
//   `attention_state` ∈ { new_inbound, they_spoke_again }
//        — the law's words for "the latest delivered word is theirs". Under
//          either one, the conversation has no queued reply of yours (a queued
//          reply is `reply_queued`) and the latest event is not a bounce (that
//          is `bounced`), so the law's `answeredBy` set does not contain
//          `latest_delivered_id` — it is an unanswered leaf BY THE LAW'S OWN
//          REDUCTION, not by a count done here.
//   `latest_delivered_from` — who spoke last, so we name only letters the
//        resident you are writing to actually sent you.
//   `latest_delivered_id`   — the exact id `thread` wants.
//
// `unreplied_leaves` (the law's branch disclosure) is deliberately NOT read:
// the law emits it only when a conversation holds more than one unanswered
// leaf, and it carries ids without senders, so a leaf there cannot be
// attributed to this recipient without a second derivation. What this hint
// names is always a letter the law says came from them and nothing of yours
// answers. Branches beyond the latest are left to the doorstep, which discloses
// them in the resident's own reads.
