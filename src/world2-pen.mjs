// world2-pen.mjs — THE PEN, FLIPPED (World 2.0 phase-3 write path, dev era).
//
// Born 2026-08-29, the night Keemin ruled the flip's shape (all four teed
// decisions, DESIGN-pen-flip.md §5): D1 PER LANE · D2 REFUSE, HONESTLY ·
// D3 REVERSE MIRROR with the existing death date · prod = box + shipped
// backups. This module is R1 and R2 of that design made real:
//
//   R1 — ONE ACT, ONE TRANSACTION. An act and its claim commit on one client
//        inside one BEGIN/COMMIT, whichever era wrote them. The two-queue
//        disease (mirrorAct and submitClaimFromJournal on independent pools
//        with nothing joining them — DESIGN §2 R1's two named instances) ends
//        here: both eras' Postgres writes route through `officeWrite`.
//
//   R2 — THE WRITE CAN REFUSE, BECAUSE IT COMES FIRST. For a FLIPPED lane the
//        Postgres commit precedes the sqlite write and is awaited; failure is
//        a typed refusal the door turns into the ruled bounce, and NOTHING has
//        been written anywhere. For a SHADOW lane nothing changes: sqlite
//        first, Postgres queued, loud on failure, parity-falsified.
//
// ── THE LANE FLAG (D1, per lane) ────────────────────────────────────────────
// W2_PEN names the lanes whose pen is Postgres, comma-separated, or "all":
//
//     W2_PEN=stance            (lane one — DESIGN §7: "the natural first
//                               candidate ... the one door that has never had
//                               a second pen to disagree with")
//     W2_PEN=stance,say,hold
//     W2_PEN=all
//
// Lane names are the lane-closure falsifier's own census vocabulary: an act
// class maps to exactly one lane (`laneOf`), and a lane not named here keeps
// the shadow-era path bit for bit.
//
// ── THE REVERSE MIRROR (D3) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// After a flipped lane's COMMIT, the sqlite journal still receives its row —
// best-effort, AFTER the record, never with a vote (DESIGN §3 step 7: "a
// rollback convenience, not a record"). It rides the mirror expiry exactly as
// the forward mirror does and dies at the replay-parity gate — and since DEC-2
// was ruled (2026-08-29 evening) that expiry is PER LANE: this lane's reverse
// mirror dies when THIS lane's read ports land and its deletion is ruled, not on
// a store-wide date (src/world2-acts.mjs § LANE_MIRROR). While it holds,
// every 1.0 read — guards included — stays valid, which is what lets a lane
// flip before the R3 read ports land: the ports gate the DELETION (rule 6),
// not the flag.
//
// ── THE REFUSAL (D2, verbatim from the ruling) ──────────────────────────────
// "the office's record cannot be reached — nothing was written, and nothing
// was lost." A door catching PenUnreachable owes the resident that sentence
// and a 503, never a degrade: a fallback pen is "a second pen wearing a
// fallback's coat" (DESIGN §5 D2). The cost is chosen knowingly: after the
// flip a Postgres outage is a visible town outage (DESIGN §4 F1).

// ── A LATE ROW MAY NOT ENTER A CERTIFIED WINDOW (the act-4171 class, 2026-09-04) ─
//
// The notary freezes each window's archive on write and certifies it nightly
// (gold §2: "frozen-on-write, an input never re-derived-into"). On 2026-09-03 a
// replayed journal line (act 4171, seq 869) was written into window 164 a day
// after that window closed and was certified; the notary refused to rewrite
// the archive — correctly — and could certify nothing new until a human deleted
// the row (notary-history/164-act-4171-repair). Then a backfill the same night
// nearly did it again with "historically correct" crossings into windows 157/160.
//
// The rule, at the pen where every row enters: a row's `crossing` may be the
// open window or the one just closed (a live act written at the boundary), never
// older. Anything older is a late arrival, and a late arrival is stamped with
// the window it ARRIVED in — the caller says so by naming the reason in
// W2_LATE_ARRIVAL, and the pen then writes `currentCrossing()` with the row's
// original crossing kept on the payload (`late_from_crossing`). `at` always
// keeps the act's true time; the crossing is where the row files, and frozen

 * the shadow arm; the flipped arm's two-argument call would have handed
 * `claimTxFromJournal` an `undefined` household and written a draft row scoped
 * to nobody — which 007's `claims_insert` WITH CHECK refuses outright, so the
 * first live private draft on a flipped lane would have bounced. One spelling,

 * Phase 5.6's private draft is the one row this pen writes that must NOT reach

 * archives/acts/<window>.jsonl into a public git repo, frozen on write) and a
 * leave-mark's payload carries the mark's BODY. The act is carried on the claim
 * instead (`data._deferred_act`) and released at the stake.
 *
 * That arm used to be a SECOND QUEUE on a second pool — `submitClaimFromJournal`
 * — and DESIGN §2 R1's own header claimed to have ended exactly that: "the
 * two-queue disease … ends here: both eras' Postgres writes route through
 * `officeWrite`." It did not end for this one, and the cost was measured rather
 * than theorised: a withdrawal's DELETE ran 113 ms ahead of the INSERT it was
 * meant to remove, five times out of five on fresh stores, leaving the
 * resident's withdrawn draft standing on the docket with its slug still taken
 * (jetto-b1-guards-report 2026-09-03 § Finding 1). `act: false` is what lets
