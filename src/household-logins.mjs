// household-logins.mjs — the town's GitHub-login → hand projection, in ONE place.
//
// Ruling 9's lesson, again: never a second resolver. The base is the town's own
// `stamp-mint.mjs currentHouseholds()` — the from-genesis truth PLUS the stamp
// ledger's dated `registry:` re-keys — and the pins are the town's own
// `tools/github-ids.json`. Nothing here parses a ledger or invents a key; this
// file only PROJECTS what the town already decided, into the two shapes its
// readers need.
//
// It was extracted from tools/world-households-export.mjs on 2026-08-27, when
// the card rail became the third reader of the same twelve lines. Two copies of
// a projection is how a login means one household on one surface and another
// household on the next; the export tool now calls these functions, so there is
// exactly one derivation and a falsifier proves its output did not move.
//
// WHY currentHouseholds AND NOT householdKeys. The export tool's own note, kept
// because it is the trap: "currentHouseholds, not householdKeys: the base is
// from-genesis truth, and a household re-key rides the stamp ledger as a dated
// registry: line — reading the bare base made a ledger-only re-key invisible to
// the parcel cap (caught 2026-08-07, the cadaeic.space unification)." The two
// disagree today on three live handles, so this is not a hypothetical.
//
// ── WHAT A CONSUMER MAY AND MAY NOT CONCLUDE ────────────────────────────────
//
// A login here names a HOUSEHOLD, never a person. `hands` is every current
// resident handle sharing that household's key, and its LENGTH is the whole
// question a money surface must ask: one hand is an answer, several hands is a
// household and not a hand, zero hands is a pin the registry has outlived.
// A consumer that picks the first of several is guessing with somebody's deed.

// ── THE SECOND KEY: a household the authorship wall can read ────────────────
//
// WHAT THE WALL ACTUALLY DOES. `settlement-sweep.mjs:905-919` and
// `tools/lane-wall.mjs:87` both resolve a sketchbook's NAME through this file's
// `logins` map — `logins[branchName.slice("draft/".length).toLowerCase()]` — and
// the sweep then compares that against the mark author's own household
// (`households[record.by]`). It leaves a branch it cannot bind ALONE rather than
// refusing it: "unverifiable is the status quo, never a new refusal (registry
// lag must not strand the pen's own writes)".
//
// SO AN UNBINDABLE KEY IS A SILENT HOLE, NOT A LOUD ONE. Every mark in such a
// household publishes with its authorship unchecked, and every test stays green
// while it happens. That is the same defect `store-writedown.mjs` exists to keep
// a RENAME from causing, arriving instead from the registry's own side.
//
// AND THE MAP ONLY EVER HELD ONE SHAPE. `loginKeys` above binds exactly two
// things: a pin's GitHub login, and a `login:`-keyed household's own name. Every
// other household key the town can mint is invisible to the wall by
// construction. Measured against the live town, 2026-09-09:
//
//     gh:<id>   150 handles · 101 distinct keys · every one bound by its pin
//     hh:<house>  8 handles ·   7 distinct keys · NOT ONE OF THEM BOUND
//     solo:<handle>  the shape `stamp-mint.householdKeys()` mints for a
//                    WHITE_PAGES room with no ADDRESS github — zero today, and
//                    the code path that makes them is live
//
// `hh:` is today's instance of the class and `solo:` was yesterday's. The rule
// below closes the class rather than either instance: EVERY household key the
// registry holds that no login binds is bound here by the sketchbook name it
// will actually carry, so the wall can read it.
//
// WHY THE NAME COMES FROM THE SAME FUNCTION THE WRITE-DOWN USES. If this planted
// one spelling and `store-writedown.sketchbookNameFor` chose another, the map
// would bind a branch nobody opens while the branch that IS opened stays
// unbindable — a fix that reads as done and changes nothing. So there is one
// resolver, `sketchbookNameForKey`, and the write-down's refusing wrapper calls
// it. Two spellings cannot exist.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TOUCH. `loginKeys` itself does not move: its
// output is also the card rail's and the Stripe attribution map's
// (`tools/stripe-watch.mjs resolveHand`), where a new key is a new way for a
// typed string to become somebody's hand. The second keys are composed onto the
// EXPORTED map in `tools/world-households-export.mjs` and nowhere else, so the
// money surface reads exactly the map it read yesterday.

 *    prevent.
 *
 * Zero of both today, over the live town — which is when a guard is cheap to
