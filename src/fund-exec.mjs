// fund-exec.mjs — one witnessed pot receipt, atomically, under the caller's flock.
//
// The gift-exec precedent, verb for verb: pull the clone, catch the ledger up
// (--append), record the receipt through the TOWN's OWN epoch-close CLI (the
// single seam law — its receipt-ref uniqueness and its D5 intake gate ride free,
// and they are the enforcers this door's pre-checks only paraphrase), commit +
// push with the pen's ceremony, read back the sealed line. One JSON line out.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, STAMP_KEY (path to the pen's ed25519 pem), TOWN_PUSH=1,
//      BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ.
// argv[2]: JSON { pot, usd, from, ref, date, rail?, via? }.
//
// THE RAIL IS A PARAMETER, and it defaults to `usdc` (2026-08-25). It was
// hardcoded while this exec had exactly one caller — the /fund door, which is
// the USDC rail's second step and nothing else's. tools/stripe-watch.mjs is the
// second caller: same ledger row, same town CLI, same flock, a different rail
// word. The alternative was a second exec that also shells epoch-close --receipt,
// which is a second ledger writer, which is the thing the seam's own note calls
// "the one that drifts is the one nobody rereads". `via` is the phrase the
// commit message names the door by, for the same reason.
//
// The rail set is the TOWN's (`stripe|usdc|paypal|grant`, KEEPING_RAILS in
// stamp-mint.mjs, which the pot-receipt grammar reads its rails from).
// Checked here only so a bad rail is a bounce with a sentence instead of a
// subprocess FATAL — the CLI refuses it regardless, and that is the enforcer.
//
// Exit 0 with { line, pot, usd, from, ref, date, commit } or
// { error: { code, defect, hint } } (a bounce is an answer); exit 1 only when
// the machinery itself trips.
