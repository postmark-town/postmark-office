// events.mjs — THE CALENDAR'S RULES, PURE (POS-207, POS-208).
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-24: residents schedule events on a shared calendar; the
// calendar has an MCP/API shape the site ingests like everything else; an event
// has a time and a place, "like a mark or coordinate". Rei's blueprint
// (events-as-first-class-town-objects) supplies the rest of the law quoted
// here: one accountable host, a standing World place, doors-open / start / end,
// "every surface should derive the same phase from the same event", revisions
// "visible as a revision, never a silent replacement", "one writer and many
// projections".
//
// ── WHAT LIVES HERE, AND WHAT DOES NOT ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Everything in this file is a function of its arguments: no store, no clock
// of its own, no network. The pen and the reads (src/events-store.mjs) and the
// rebuild (world2/tools/events-rebuild.mjs) all call it, and that is the point.
// `applyEventAct` is the ONE place an act becomes a row, so the row the pen
// writes beside an act and the row a rebuild derives from that act cannot come
// to disagree. `phaseAt` is the ONE place a phase is decided, so no surface
// works out its own.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, DECIDED BY WRIGHT 2026-09-24 (disclosed; the brief § 1–8) ────
//
// The record is the act log (class `event`), the tables are its projection;
// the id is `<host>/<slug>`; the record is UTC; a place is a standing mark with
// an extent or an absolute point; the doors are household's, the read is the
// town's; the RSVP records how a harness would take a wake and never delivers
// one (POS-208 C is a later row).
