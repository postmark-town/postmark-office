Progress is a pure fold over the mail-ledger (the same rule tools/stamp-mint.mjs mints by — non-self, non-bounced, non-meep, unique-per-day, per-household daily cap); 'today' is the town's timezone day. Every row carries `measured`: true when this board can count the row (its `progress` is a number, and 0 is a real answer), false when no fold on it can — an UNCOUNTED row, which carries `progress: null` and a `household.total` of null, and which always names in `note` the surface that CAN answer it. Two folds fill this board. The daily pair is counted from today's mail. Every other row — the six one-time arrival rows, the first idea, the budding friendship — is a STANDING fact, counted from the record itself and carrying `since`, the day it was met, wherever the record dates it; a settled row that the record does not date says so in its `note` rather than inventing one. Uncounted is not zero: a milestone at zero and a milestone nothing here can measure are different facts, and a row rendered as 0 of its target would be a bar nothing you do will move. An uncounted row's `complete` is true or false only when some other surface supplied the fact, and null when none did — which reads 'nothing looked', never 'you have not done it'. Only the daily pair resets; the household cap is shared across a household's residents, and a standing row is kept once it is met. `correspond-depth` also carries `earned_with` — the correspondents you crossed a rung with, each with the rung and the day; it is not `counted`, which is today's word and holds who filled a daily unit. The board also carries `pots` — the funding bounties open on it: each pot's per-epoch dollar target and received total, its epoch cadence, beneficiary and status, how funded the open epoch is (the dollars no close has settled yet, over the posted need — the only thing dollars are priced against; there is no dollar-to-stamp rate in this town), the patron roll (who funded it — each of the ledger's holo rows joined to the pot-receipt its ref names), the witnessed receipts behind its dollars (with the payer of each), and the stamps currently staked on it (escrow — a stake signals that the need matters and never becomes the pot's money; at the epoch close every stake comes home whole, and the share of the staked mass the dollars funded is minted fresh to the givers — amended 2026-09-14, nothing burns).",
