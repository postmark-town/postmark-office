// settlements.mjs — what the keeper has actually blessed, and when.
//
// THE NUMBER COUNTS BLESSINGS, NOT BEATS (Keemin/Wright, 2026-08-08). Settlement
// runs on the 06:00/18:00Z heartbeat, but the gate can REFUSE — S22 was refused
// at this morning's heartbeat — and a refused gate does not increment. So the
// number cannot be derived from the clock: arithmetic off a cadence would have
// told the whole town "S23" tomorrow while the record still said S21, and the
// refusal case is not an edge (it happened twice this week).
//
// The truth is the world repo's own git TAGS, `settlement/S<n>`, which exist
// only when a settlement actually landed. The tag's commit date is when it was
// blessed. Nothing else in the repo carries the number:
// settlement-publications.json is a map of WHICH marks are published and holds
// neither an index nor a date.
//
// Read-only, keyless, and derived from the clone the office already keeps —
// tags ride the tick's existing fetch, so freshness costs no per-request work.

/**
 * IS THIS DIRECTORY A REPO, OR IS IT STANDING INSIDE SOMEONE ELSE'S?
 *
 * `git -C <dir>` ASCENDS. Handed a directory that is not a repo, git walks up
 * the tree until it finds one, and then answers about THAT repo without saying
 * it did. Measured on this box, 2026-09-05:
 *
 *     $ git -C <a fresh mkdtemp under %TEMP%> rev-parse --show-toplevel
 *     C:/Users/keemi
 *     $ git -C <the same dir> tag -l 'settlement/*'
 *     settlement/S1 … settlement/S58
 *
 * — a home directory that happens to be a git repo, forty-odd real settlement
 * tags, and a caller who asked about an empty temp folder. This is not a
 * Windows quirk and not a test-only accident: any deploy path nested under a
 * checkout gets the same wrong answer, and it is wrong in the worst direction,
 * because a settlement number the viewer trusts would be some other repo's.
 *
 * So the question is asked properly: the directory must BE the top of a work
 * tree, not merely stand somewhere inside one. Anything else is "no repo", which
 * is already an answer this function has and already returns honestly.
 *
 * `--show-toplevel` rather than `--is-inside-work-tree`: the latter is true for
 * every subdirectory, which is exactly the case being refused.
 *
 * Exported for `world2/tools/settlements-backfill.mjs`, which reads the same
 * tags from a caller-supplied checkout and must refuse the same wrong answer.
