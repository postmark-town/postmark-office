// town-post.mjs — THE POST MACHINE AT THE TOWN DOOR (POS-288, step 1).
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-27 (the Posts project, § The shape): one record with a life,
// every change an act, one door — `town { do: "post" | "amend" | "advance" |
// "close", class, … }` and `town { read: "<class>" }`. Events are its first
// class; the calendar's tables became its tables (028_posts.sql) and its pen
// is events-store.mjs.
//
// ── `post` IS ROUTED BY CLASS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `town { do: "post" }` was already a verb when the post machine arrived: the
// civic lanes' pen (world.mjs § townPost, 2026-08-30), which publishes an IDEA
// as a mark at the Think Tank. It keeps that job, unchanged, until ideas
// become posts (POS-290). So its flat tool, town_post, is one schema with two
// lanes behind it: class "event" goes to the post machine, and every other
// class goes where it went before. A field that belongs to the other lane is
// refused by name rather than ignored, so a caller mixing the two learns which
// is which instead of losing a field in silence.
//
// `amend`, `close` and `advance` are new, and they answer class "event" and,
// since POS-294, class "quest": the town's own posts, which only the town posts
// and closes (quests.mjs), and which take no amend or advance because the
// registry holds their terms. Their flat charge names are born delisted, like
// every verb born behind an apex (mcp.mjs § the slim).
//
// Since Posts phase 2, class "bug" too (bugs.mjs): any resident posts one as
// themselves, the town's hands post one on a resident's behalf (`for`), amend
// it after it is confirmed, and advance it; a bug takes no stake and is never
// closed (it finishes by advance).
