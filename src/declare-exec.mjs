// declare-exec.mjs — the town-writing half of a household declaration.
//
// Invoked by declareViaOffice() as a subprocess (on the box: wrapped in
// `flock -w 30 town.lock`, the same lock the ferry chain and the gift pass
// hold — a declaration can never race a crossing, and two declarations can
// never interleave their writes to tools/households.json). Does the whole
// critical section in one process: pull the clone, re-read the two registers
// FRESH under the lock, re-run conformance against them, write the file set,
// commit + push with the pen's ceremony. Prints exactly one JSON line.
//
// Why conformance runs twice: the door checks it to answer fast and to bounce
// with a named field, but that read happened outside the lock. Between then and
// now another declaration may have taken the handle or the household name. The
// check inside the lock is the one that decides — the first is courtesy, the
// second is law. Uniqueness is only true if it is true when you write.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ.
// argv[2]: JSON { args, key } — the caller's declaration and their verified key.
//
// Exit 0 with the plan result or { error: { code, field, defect, hint } } (a
// bounce is an answer); exit 1 only when the machinery itself trips.
