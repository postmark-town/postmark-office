 * ids that disagreed. **GitHub releases abandoned logins for re-registration.**
 * A stranger who claims a resident's old login therefore satisfied the login

 * pinned resident is deliberately NOT login-matchable: their old login may have
 * been abandoned and re-registered by a stranger, and their ADDRESS `github:`
 * string is display-only."* This is that law, applied at the places that decide.
 *
 * The row's pinned-ness is what decides, not the caller's: if the ROW carries an
 * id, only an id can match it. That is deliberate and slightly stricter than
 * "compare ids when both have them" — a caller with no verified id must not
 * reach a pinned account by naming it, which is precisely the recycled-login
 * attack. A legacy row with a login and no id keeps matching by login, so
 * nothing pinned breaks and nothing unpinned regresses.
 *
 * Vendored deliberately: the town repo carries the identical rule in
 * `tools/account-match.mjs`, and the two must move together. If this changes,
 * that changes in the same round.
