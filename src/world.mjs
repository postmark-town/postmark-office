// takes no more lines. `dynamic.db/movements` is era two. A reader that knows
// only the first one is reading a town that stopped moving on the day of the
// freeze — which is exactly what shipped, and what this function exists to end.
//
// THE DISEASE THIS IS THE CURE FOR. Four live sites each assembled departures
// from `parseWalkLedger` alone: the standpoint, hearing, the walk's own `from`,
// and the walkers door. One question — where has this resident been — with four
// derivations that agreed only while there was a single era to read. The day the
// freeze landed, twenty-seven residents had an ashore record in the store that
// no reader consulted, so `world_walkers` served them at the berth they had left
// and `/world/present` could not find them at all. That is issue #7's disease
// again, one layer down and across a seam this time; the cure is the same one —
// ONE function, and every site calls it.
//
// CONCAT, NOT SORT — and the first draft of this got it wrong.
//
// Sorting the merged list by instant looks like the safer choice and is not.
// THE LEDGER'S FILE ORDER IS ITS LAW: it is append-only and "latest wins" means
// latest APPENDED, which the engine implements by taking the last match in array
// order. Those two orders disagree in the real ledger — the 2026-08-08 sailing
// filed every passenger at `18:00:00.000Z` and those lines were appended after
// walks stamped 18:16 — so re-sorting era one by instant silently changes WHICH
// RECORD GOVERNS for any resident with out-of-order lines. That is a semantic
// change to the founding era, made by a reader, which is the one thing the seam
// promised not to do. (Caught by the flag-off door test: 317 records in, first
// divergence at index 105, rook-of-garrison governed by a different leg.)
//
// So era one keeps its own order, untouched, and era two is appended after it —
// correct because every store record postdates the freeze. That assumption is
// CHECKED rather than trusted: a store record older than the newest ledger line
// means the freeze assumption has broken, and it is disclosed instead of being
// quietly mis-ordered.
//
// FEATURE-DETECTED, DISCLOSED, ERA-1 ON ANY FAILURE. With the flag off the record
// is not read at all and this returns exactly what `parseWalkLedger` returned.

//                the two are answering different questions.) Whose body lent
//                the standpoint rides the payload where it belongs.
//   written_at   voice.at — WHEN IT WAS SAID, not when this hook ran.
//   at           stamped at the voice's OWN x/y (witnessStampAt), never at the
//                speaker's position now.
//   witnesses    who was within earshot, pinned — the-witnessed-line's plural,
//                and for speech the most literal witnesses this log will ever
//                hold.
//   household    `resolvedWorldHousehold(key)` — THE SAME RESOLVER THE MARK
//                LANE USES, threaded down through `voices.say` rather than

 * reconstructs the instant exactly ZERO times, median −203 ms, 235 of them
 * missing by more than a second, the worst by 10.6 hours. The register could
 * not render the record while its instant was the mirror's clock.

 * — and the bulk was `radial.byBearing`: a fan of lists keyed by bearing and
 * then by distance band, each holding the SAME object rows that `fov.carried`
 * and `fov.far` already carry. Verified before touching it, at three
 * standpoints: same ids, same keys, same values, no row in one that is not in
 * the other. It is the only place on the surface where the NUMBER OF LISTS
 * multiplies rather than one list growing — six bearings today, up to sixteen,
 * each with up to five bands.
 *
 * What `radial` uniquely contributes is the ORGANISATION — which bearing, which
 * band, in what order. So the organisation stays, in full, and the object
 * bodies become ids pointing at `fov`, where they already were. Each band also
 * gains its own `count`, which it never had: nine uncounted lists in one block
 * is the `capped` lesson unlearned nine times over.
 *
 * Nothing becomes unknowable — every id resolves inside the same answer. This
 * is a reference replacing a restatement, not a bound cutting a list, so there
 * is nothing here a reader has to go fetch.
 *
 * Exported for its own falsifier: the dedupe is the part that can quietly rot
 * if the engine ever grows a radial field `fov` does not carry, and a test that
 * could only reach it through a hydrated world store would not run in CI.

//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The radial NAMES ids: `objects` here, `within`/`nearby`
// on the apex. Every reader of those ids then has to resolve each one against
// something else — and the one thing every reader had was the whole fold. So a
// door that answers "what can you see from here" in a few dozen entries was
// only usable by a caller holding 1,197 marks, which is the fold's cost paid to
// read a radial that deliberately is not the fold.
//
// So the read carries what it names. Not more: the promise is exactly "every id
// this response names, plus the town's ground", and its falsifiers are that
// biconditional in both directions — an id with no record is a broken read, and
// a record for an id the response never named is the fold creeping back in.
//
// THE GROUND SET is the one whole that is not derived from the standpoint, and
// it is here because the painting's FLOOR is not a thing you can see — it is
// the sheet the seen things stand on. It is small and it is fixed: the thirteen
// region rings the record's own roster names, plus the water the skeleton's own
// selection names. It is NOT a second fold: it does not grow with the town's
// marks, only with the town's REGIONS, which is a founding act.
//
// ⚑ THE SELECTION IS RESTATED HERE, and that is a cost, not a tidiness. The
// viewer owns the same rule in `townRegionMarks`/`townWaterShapes`
// (spectator/viewer.mjs), and those live in a DOM module the office cannot
// import. What is reused rather than restated is every part that can be: the
// roster (`REGION_SLUGS`), the ring reader (`polygonOf`) and the water
// selection (`waterFeatures`/`seaFeature`) all come from the engine the office
// already imports. What is restated is the ten-line join and the sentinel cut.
// If the ground ever needs a third reader, that is the moment the rule earns a

// with MAX_IMAGE = 1.5 MB. That is a storage ceiling, and every media object
// is bounded by it at birth.
//
// This door asks a different question: "should these bytes ride back inside a
// JSON-RPC answer?" That is a TRANSPORT budget, and it is not the storage
// ceiling's business. Base64 inflates by 4/3, so a ceiling-sized 1.5 MB image
// is ~2 MB of JSON string — against the 3 MB this door accepts on a REQUEST
// (mcp.mjs), which is the nearest yardstick the codebase has for what it
// considers a large payload here. 1 MB is that budget: ~1.37 MB on the wire,
// comfortably under the yardstick, and large enough to inline the great
// majority of the town's images.
//
// Reusing MAX_IMAGE here would look like tidiness and cost the thing that
// matters: sitting BELOW the storage ceiling is what makes the over-cap branch
// REACHABLE BY A LAWFUL UPLOAD. A resident can shelve a 1.2 MB image today and
// walk that path. Pinned to the seam's number the branch would be dead code
// guarding only a seam bypass — a rail nobody can test is a rail nobody can

    // the private/public line falls, so staking a mark IS putting it forward,
    // and the door's job is to rule on the AMOUNT against the ground it stands
    // on. That verdict rides the declaration as `put_forward`, because the
    // docket pen cannot read law and this is the one place that can.
    //
    // Computed here rather than at the door's mouth because `canon` is already
    // open on this line — the ground question is a canon question, and opening
    // the record twice to ask it once is how the two halves would drift.
    //
    // ── AN AMENDMENT IS RULED ON THE MARK'S ESCROW, NOT ONLY THIS ACT'S ────
    //
    // (#2614, hotfix w38.3.) The rule above reads the ACT. That is right for a
    // mark being left for the first time, and wrong for one being amended: the
    // stake rides the id, not the text, so a mark already standing with escrow
    // behind it has ALREADY been put forward — and an amendment carrying no
    // `stamps:` was filing itself as a private draft anyway. The reply said so
    // and, in the same breath, said the opposite: `disclosePublishing` read the
    // MARK's escrow and promised "the amendment publishes at the next
    // crossing" for a claim this line had just ruled a draft. One answer, two
    // truths, and the resident's word never reached the docket — measured on
    // the 09-13 scratch as ten of Deva's amendments sitting at `status: draft`,
    // `stake: 0`, one of them since 09-06.
    //
    // So the verdict is one verdict now: an amendment goes forward when the
    // escrow ALREADY behind the mark clears the ground it stands on, exactly as
    // a fresh stake of that size would. On the author's own ground the minimum
    // is zero and there is nothing to read — amending your own parcel is a
    // putting-forward for the same reason `stamps: 0` is.
    //
    // The escrow read is the SAME read the reply's sentence made, moved ahead
    // of the ruling instead of behind it, and it is not an extra call: the
    // sentence no longer makes its own (§ disclosePublishing). A read that
    // cannot answer counts as zero — the safe direction this file already

  // ── AN EMBODIED HUMAN'S WALK IS REFUSED, AND LOUDLY (2026-08-27) ───────────
  //
  // THE OWN HAND is the one thing the human class exists to protect: it
  // `implements: ["the-town/the-own-hand"]`, and human-actor.mjs says what that
  // costs — "A record that wrote the resident's name on a human's words would be
  // the one thing this class exists to prevent." A walk is a record of a BODY
  // MOVING THROUGH THE WORLD: `declareMovement` writes `actor` into
  // dynamic.db/movements, position is derived from that row, and every reader
  // downstream — the standpoint, presence, the crossing-save's STATE/log/ line —
  // treats that actor as a thing standing somewhere.
  //
  // So this door has exactly two ways to write an embodied human's walk and both
  // are false:
  //
  //   · UNDER THE RESIDENT'S HAND — which is the violation itself, and the
  //     silent one: the resident's body moves, on the record, on the human's
  //     word, and nothing anywhere says a human was involved.
  //   · UNDER THE HUMAN'S HAND — which writes a walker the world cannot place.
  //     The human has no home mark, no standpoint and no presence row; `from`
  //     would fall back to `homeCoords` and stand them at the Origin, and the save
  //     would crystallize an entity the atlas has no seat for.
  //
  // The second is the humans-as-residents design, and LOGOS/classes.md § The
  // human class is explicit that it has not arrived: "everything further waits
  // for the humans-as-residents design, and arrives — if it arrives — as law
  // here first." § The three channels does grant the walk ("A human embodied by
  // their own parcel may walk within its extent and no further") and the human
  // class mark now carries a pace dial for it — so the LAW is ready and the
  // RECORD is not. That gap is the office's, and this is the office saying so
  // out loud instead of picking whichever falsehood is quieter.
  //
  // A refusal is the correct terminal state here, not a placeholder: the same
  // shape `walkAllowed` uses one door up ("The refusal NAMES its reason; it is
  // not a silent clip"), and the same 501 the apex answers with when law opens a
  // door the office has not built a room behind.
  // ── THE SEAT ANSWERS THE SECOND FALSEHOOD (founder-ruled 2026-08-29) ──────
  //
  // The refusal below named two ways to write an embodied walk and called both
  // false. It was right about both, and it missed a third that the founder has
  // now ruled: WRITE THE SEAT'S WALK AND SAY WHOSE ACT IT WAS.
  //
  // LOGOS § The three channels: "Any act needing a record WRITES THROUGH THE
  // SEAT — the resident whose household hosts the human — and the answer says
  // so. The human has no home mark, no standpoint and no threshold record; the
  // seat has all three, and they are the ones actually moving. … writing the
  // seat's name in SILENCE is the ghost-writing the human class exists to
  // prevent. The disclosure is what makes the difference."
  //
  // So the first horn — "under the resident's hand … and nothing anywhere says
  // a human was involved" — is answered exactly where it was sharpest: the
  // silence. The row is the seat's because the seat is the body that moves, and
  // `acted_by` on the answer is the part that was missing.
  //
  // ⚑ FENCED TO A SEATING GROUND, and this office does not decide which. The
  // apex resolves seating from the admitted calculus (scope and all) and names
  // it in `__seated_ground`; without that word this door still refuses, so the
  // flat tool and the REST body reach the 501 exactly as before. The escalation
  // question is answered one line down regardless: `who` must be a resident THIS
  // KEY HOLDS, so the worst a forged word can buy is a walk the caller could

  // Two rulings, one lookup, and they belong together because they are the same
  // question asked twice: WHERE ON THIS FLOOR DOES A BODY GET TO STAND.
  //
  // LOGOS § The arena: "An entrant into a wheel-keeping ground is placed where
  // the ground was entered from — the point on its boundary the crossing came
  // through — and never within an adversary's own extent. Where that edge point
  // falls inside one, the placement steps back OUT along the way in until it is
  // clear, by arithmetic every reader repeats identically."
  //
  // LOGOS § The portal ground: "`walk_min_step` is a dial on the ground's own
  // mark, in metres: within that ground a walk is validated and snapped at that
  // granularity instead of the town's whole-metre step. Absent — which is every
  // ground in the town on the day this is written — the town-wide step governs
  // and nothing anywhere changes."
  //
  // ⚑ EVERYTHING HERE IS FENCED BEHIND A GROUND THAT SAID SOMETHING. A walk to
  // an ordinary mark reaches none of it: `arenaGroundAt` answers null for
  // anything that is not a portal ground, `walk_min_step` is null for a ground
  // that has not declared one, and the placement only ever fires for a ground
  // that KEEPS A WHEEL. Which is the whole safety of the change — the founder
  // asked for a finer floor in one room, not a re-cut of the town's stride.
  //
  // ONE DECISION, MADE IN arena.mjs AND APPLIED HERE. `arrivalOnGround` owns
  // both rulings and their order; this desk owns the store read and the pen.
  // The split is what makes the decision falsifiable at all — see that
  // function's own note on why a walk desk with no test harness must not be
