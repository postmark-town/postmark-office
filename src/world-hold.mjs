// world-hold.mjs — WHO HOLDS WHAT. The object primitive's one verb.
//
// `give`, `drop` and `take` are three faces of one act: DECLARE THE HOLDING.
// The edit law has one primitive ("to act is to declare an edge; everything
// else is clothing"), so there is one executor here and three actions on the
// class mark, because the vocabulary a resident reads and the machinery that
// runs are allowed to differ in number.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT CONTAINMENT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN ───────────────────
//
// The obvious implementation is "the thing's containment edge points at the
// resident, and children ride their parent's frame." It cannot be built, and
// the reason is law rather than a gap:
//
//   AN ENTITY HAS NO GEOMETRIC PARENT, EVER (LOGOS/kinds.md, restated at
//   dynamic-store.mjs § entities and dynamic-entities.mjs law 2). The entities
//   table has no parent column and never will. A resident is not a mark, has no
//   directory in WORLD/marks/, and cannot be a carrier — carriers are marks
//   with `mobility: derived|free` AND a `mechanic:` (world-frames.mjs), and
//   that `mechanic` clause exists precisely so that standing in the building
//   that houses a class is not riding it.
//
// So carrying is the OTHER edge the LOGOS already named, and which has stood in
// the Keeping Works since 2026-08-09 without ever having a verb:
//
//   the-town/attachment — "An attachment is born saying what becomes of it if
//   what it holds to moves — carried along, or set down."
//
// Its table and its writer shipped in Stage 2 with a comment saying the verb
// that calls them "lands with the vessel work." It did not. This is that verb.
//
// ── POSITION IS DERIVED, NEVER STORED ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A held thing's world position is `holder's position + offset`, computed on
// read — the same arithmetic world-frames.mjs already runs for passengers, and
// the same discipline the-north-star.md states ("derived things are stored by
// no one"). The alternative — rewriting the mark's `at:` on every hand-off —
// would be a git commit per transfer AND would store a derived quantity. The
// mark file of a thing is BYTE-IDENTICAL across any number of gives; a test
// asserts exactly that, because it is the claim most worth being able to break.
//
// ── HELD vs SET DOWN, and the one judgement call in this file ────────────────
//
// The attachments table is store-canon-DURABLE and replayed by the crossing
// save, so it is the wrong table to migrate on a first pass. It carries no
// `closed_at`, so "set down" needs a spelling in the columns that exist.
//
// The spelling: LATEST ROW PER TARGET WINS (`born_at`, then `seq` — the order
// readAttachments already returns and a replay already applies), and `policy`
// says whether that latest row is a holding:
//
//   policy: cascade   HELD. It comes along when the holder moves.
//   policy: detach    SET DOWN. The edge is in the log; the holding is not.
//
// This reads the column with its own declared meaning ("carried along, or set
// down") and needs no migration. It is nonetheless A CHOICE I MADE, not a
// ruling I was given, and it is the thing to overturn first if the store ever
// grows an explicit terminal column — at which point `liveHolder` below is the
// one function that changes.

//

//             last place the thing was folded")

    // it is not better for being mine.

    // door too: `declareHolding` is the pure adjudicator, tested on hand-built
    // stores with no world db and no journal anywhere near it, and a shroud
    // inside it would hand every one of those tests two dependencies it has no
    // business having. This door is where the stores already are.
    //
    // BOTH VERBS, ONE CHECK. give/drop/take are one primitive here, and the
    // shroud is a fact about the OBJECT, so a hand that somehow has the wick end
    // cannot pass it on either — which is the honest reading of "neither

    // ⛔ IT WAS INSIDE `declareHoldingFlipped` FOR ONE COMMIT, and the suite
    // caught it: that function is documented as provable "on a hand-built store
    // with no world db and no Postgres", its whole `deps` parameter exists for
    // that, and a reach check inside it handed all three pen-ordering tests a
    // world engine, a clone and a walk ledger they have no business having.
    // Exactly the mistake this file's header warns about twice, made a third
    // time by me. The law belongs at the door, where the world already is.
    //
    // ON THE ORDERING, and why hoisting it above the flip branch is safe. B1
    // requires the HOLDER check to sit inside the write transaction, and it
    // still does — `declareHoldingFlipped` re-reads the rows after
    // `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and `declareHolding` adjudicates ownership there. What
    // is read here is GEOMETRY, and the only thing a stale face can do is send
    // the wrong clause to a call the transaction then refuses on ownership
    // anyway. The one crossing case — a `drop` at check time that is a `take`
    // by commit time — means the actor dropped it in between, so they are
    // standing exactly where it now lies, and the reach it skipped would have

// ── THE HOLDING GAP, CLOSED (2026-08-28) ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Third instance of the say gap's class: a live write lane whose pen is not the
// journal, and so invisible to World 2.0. Here the pen is the `attachments`
// table (`declareAttachment`, dynamic-entities.mjs), and give/drop/take are
// three of the world's thirteen apex actions — nothing anyone has picked up,
// handed over or set down since the seed had a line in `acts`.
//
// HOOKED AT THE DOOR, NOT INSIDE `declareHolding`, and that is deliberate:
// `declareHolding` is the pure adjudicator — it takes a db and no key, it is
// tested directly on hand-built stores, and giving it a mirror would give every
// one of those tests a Postgres dependency it has no business having. The door
// is where a key exists (so the household resolves the way every other act's
// does) and where success is unambiguous: `declareHolding` THROWS on refusal,
// so a returned value is a declaration that landed.
//
// THE LAZY IMPORT IS THE POINT, not a shortcut. `world.mjs` imports this file,
// so a static import back would close a cycle; `await import(...)` inside the
// async body is the idiom this codebase already uses for exactly this
// (world-stake.mjs reaching world2-claims.mjs). It also means a store with the
// mirror off never loads world.mjs's world at all.
//
// Privacy: a holding is public by the door's own law — "what it does instead is
// RECORD every take with the resident who made it, so a ground-holder who
// objects has the record to point at" (world_hold's description). The thing is
// a public mark id and the actor is the resident who acted. Nothing new leaves
// the box.

//
//   the door refuses (403/409/422)  → nothing in either store
//   the pen is unreachable          → 503, the ruled sentence, nothing in either store
//   the pen commits                 → acts holds the record; attachments + journal commit together
//
// A sqlite write transaction held across the pen's round-trip is deliberate
// and short (one INSERT-sized window); it is exactly the property that makes
