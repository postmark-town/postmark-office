// standing-store.mjs — the standing ledger, READ FROM AND WRITTEN TO THE STORE
// (POS-347, migration 060).
//
// `src/standing.mjs` holds the grammar, the fold, the honest sentence and the
// gate. This file is the half that touches Postgres: it reads and appends
// `standing_acts` through the office's ONE pool (`world2-acts.mjs actsQuery`,
// `WORLD2_PG_URL`, role `office_api`), and it renders the town's
// `tools/standing-ledger.md` from the rows, so the file is an export.
//
// ── NULL IS NOT EMPTY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The registry-store rule (src/registry-store.mjs § NULL IS NOT EMPTY), kept
// all the way up: `loadStandingActs()` answers `null` for "this office is not
// pointed at the record" and an array for "I looked". The gate reads null as
// "no standing record here", which is the ordinary case for an office with no
// store (a test, a dev box): nobody can have been suspended in a record that
// does not exist. A store that is pointed at and THROWS is different, and the
// gate says so (src/standing.mjs § standingBounce): it never reads an error as
// good standing.
