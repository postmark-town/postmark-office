// clone predates the pair answers 501 by name rather than inventing a fallback
// law, because a door that guesses at the law it is enforcing is worse than a

//
// "every Post Office stop mark … acts as a Portal into the Post Office, which
//  (as portals do) has different physical rules than usual."
//
// A stop on a vehicle's timetable is a DOOR INTO HER, wherever her hull is. You
// must stand at the stop — the 2026-08-27/09-11 reach rule is unchanged and is
// measured at the STOP, which is the mark you named. What changes is which
// threshold you cross: the vehicle's, not the wharf's.
//
// ⚑ THE PORTAL CROSSING IS ONE LINK, AND IT HAS TO BE. Measured against world
// main `5beca99a`: `enterExitPlan` computes the Post Office's chain as
// `the-town/the-town-centre → the-town/the-quay-reach → the-town/the-post-office`
// — her geometric ancestors at her berth. Running a portal entry through
// `verbs.enter` would therefore write THREE ledger rows and put a resident
// standing on the Garrison's wharf inside the town centre, five kilometres from
// any of it, because the chain is computed from the TARGET's static geometry and
// a portal's passage is not geometric. The brief's own words are "ONE enter row
// … object the-town/the-post-office", and this is that sentence in code.
//
// So the adjudication is the CLONE's, one link: `adjudicate` and
// `formatEnterExit` out of the grammar module the office already loads. The
// office does not invent an entry law here any more than it does anywhere else;
// it asks the same law about one door instead of about a chain.
