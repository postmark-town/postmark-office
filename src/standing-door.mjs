// standing-door.mjs — the Registrar writes standing through the office (POS-347).
//
//   household { do: "standing", args: { act, handle, reason, founder_word? } }
//
// RULED (Darko, 2026-10-04): the store is the record. Before this door the
// Registrar suspended a resident by committing a line to the town's
// `tools/standing-ledger.md` with `tools/registrar-audit.mjs act`, and the
// office read that file. Now the act is a row in `standing_acts` (060), written
// here, and the file is rendered from the store in the same pen commit
// (tools/standing-drain.mjs). The town CLI still works: a line it commits is
// adopted by the next drain (the store reads git), so nothing the Registrar
// already knows how to do stops working on the day this ships.
//
// ── WHO MAY CALL IT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Registrar, with wright as backup: the list settle-join holds and for the
// same reason (src/settle-join.mjs § WHO MAY CALL IT). An operator act, so it
// is unlisted (household-apex.mjs § OPERATOR_ACTS): to any other key it answers
// as a name the door has never heard of. `by:` on the line is the caller's own
// handle from that list, never a field the caller supplies.
//
// ── WHAT IT CHECKS (the town's planAct, verbatim in substance) ──────────────
//
//   · act is quarantine, lift or revoke; handle is well formed;
//   · a reason, with no `·` (the separator is the parse);
//   · a REVOKE needs the founder's word, quoted verbatim, always; and lifting a
//     REVOCATION needs it too — the stronger act takes the stronger hand in
//     both directions;
//   · a lift needs a current suspension (a no-op lift reads as a real act later);
//   · quarantine and revoke need a resident: a handle in a household of the
//     store's registry (019), the record of who lives here;
//   · the line it would write parses back to itself.
//
// Every refusal names itself and writes nothing. The checks against current
// standing run UNDER THE TOWN LOCK, after the file's own lines are adopted, so
// two acts cannot both pass against the same stale standing.
//
// ── A LOST PUSH RESUMES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The row lands in the store before the pen commits (lesson 30: a store write
// survives the clone's rollback). The same call again finds its line already
// held (`line` is UNIQUE), answers `recorded: false, already: true`, and drains
// the file; the next keep tick drains it regardless.
