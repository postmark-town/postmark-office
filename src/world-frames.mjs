// world-frames.mjs — THE FRAME LAW (ruled 2026-08-10, Keemin + Wright).
//
//   Everything has a reference frame. An entity's frame is the deepest CARRIER
//   it is within; the world is the default frame. Position is always an offset
//   in your frame.
//
// This file replaces Stage D's first answer — a declared attachment, validated
// by presence at a cast-off instant — and the replacement is smaller than what
// it replaces. The ceremony had three moving parts (a declaration act, a
// validation rule, a lapse rule) and one hard question it kept re-asking: was
// this person aboard AT THE MOMENT SHE SAILED. The frame law has one part and
// never asks that question, because there is no such moment: you are carried if
// your frame is the carrier when it moves, and it does not matter when that was.
//
// FOUR SENTENCES DO ALL THE WORK.
//
//   1. A CARRIER IS CLASS-DECLARED. `mobility: derived|free` on the class. A
//      district never carries; a vessel does. Nothing here knows the word
//      "boat" — see `carriersFrom`, which reads the Keeping Works.
//
//   2. A WALK NEVER BOARDS. Keemin, 2026-09-26: "simply 'walking aboard'
//      shouldn't put you on the boat anymore." You board a carrier only
//      through a stop's door (#2986, Keemin-ruled 2026-09-19: aboard is
//      occupancy, read off the enter-exit ledger). A walk that ends on her
//      deck leaves you on the quay beside her. What a walk still does is END
//      a frame: a step that lands outside her footprint is stepping off.
//
//   3. CARRIAGE IS NOTHING HAPPENING. She sails, your offset holds, you moved.
//      This is what relative coordinates were for — the keystone rides the
//      house and the passenger rides the boat by one arithmetic.
//
//   4. ENTITIES ARE POINTS. A point is in exactly one frame, so the straddler
//      question never arises and there is no straddle logic anywhere below.
//
// WHERE THE FRAME IS EVALUATED, and why it is the endpoint. A movement record
// is declared in the frame the entity is standing in, and the frame is re-decided
// AT ARRIVAL. Since 2026-09-26 the only frame change a walk can make is the
// ending of one: an endpoint outside her footprint steps you off, and an endpoint
// on her deck — from ashore — boards nobody (ruling 2 above). The arrival
// instant keeps the derivation total and replayable —
// no continuous crossing-solve, no sampling rate to argue about, same answer in
// every clone.
//
// NO NEW STORAGE. Frame edges are DERIVED by the one fold below, from the
// movement records that already exist. They are reported as events (the
// `happened` shelf) by filtering the fold's own transitions — never by a second
// table that could disagree with the records it was built from.

// broken read looks like. So the absence is reported rather than returned as an
// empty list, and a caller that ignores the disclosure at least cannot say it
