// state-log-from-store.mjs — THE PHOTOGRAPH, RE-DERIVED FROM THE REGISTER.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHY IT HAD TO EXIST BEFORE THE SWAP ────────────────────
//
// `src/world-drain.mjs` does two jobs the G1 plan counts as one. Besides the
// sketchbooks it writes `STATE/log/<N>.journal.jsonl` (+ `.journal.meta.json`)
// and commits them into the world repo — the last git-era crossing's receipt
// names `state_commit cae5f27b`. Drop the drain and that writer goes with it.
//
// The drain's own header says why nobody could re-derive those rows, verbatim:
//
//     "The journal's rows are CONSUMED — after the truncate they exist nowhere
//      else — so crossing-save could never re-derive them, and the first time it
//      rewrote a window it would erase them."
//
// That sentence is true of the SQLITE journal and false of the register. In the
// store the same acts are rows in `acts`, and nothing truncates them. So the
// re-derivation the drain calls impossible is possible — and this module is it.
//
// ── WHAT IT IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is NOT a second serializer. `world-drain.logLine` owns the line grammar and
// this module reproduces its field order deliberately, in one place, with the
// drain's own comment quoted at the reconstruction so the two cannot drift
// silently. If `logLine` gains a column, `LINE_FIELDS` below goes red in
// `test/state-log-from-store.test.mjs` before anything reaches a world repo.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THE REGISTER CANNOT GIVE BACK, MEASURED ─────────────────
//
// Measured on prod 2026-09-08 against `STATE/log/177.journal.jsonl` at
// `settlement/S63` (`256db2fe`), 11 lines, seq 1364–1378:
//
//   1. `seq` — NO STORE SOURCE AT ALL. `acts.journal_seq` is the shadow-era
//      pairing key and it is NULL for 4,483 of 4,689 rows; its highest non-null
//      value is 1115, from 2026-09-05. Every act in window 177 has it null,
//      because the pen for those lanes is already flipped and there was no
//      sqlite seq to pair. `acts.id` is the register's own sequence and it is
//      monotone in exactly the order the journal's was, so it is the honest
//      successor — but it is a DIFFERENT NUMBERING, which is why `seqOf` is a
//      parameter and why `MERGE_HAZARD` below is a refusal and not a note.
//
//   2. `at`, for a PRIVATE DRAFT declaration. Phase 5.6 defers an unstaked mark
//      (`world-journal.mjs § privateDraftAct`): the sqlite row is written at the
//      COMPOSE and no act is mirrored until a stake puts it forward, and
//      `world2-claims.mjs § promoteDraftOnStake` dates the act at the putting-
//      forward — "the world witnessed a resident put this mark forward; it did
//      not witness them thinking about it". Both instants are correct and the
//      register holds only the later one. In window 177 that is three of eleven
//      lines, 8.9s / 9.0s / 13.4s late. The compose instant survives in the
//      photograph and NOWHERE ELSE: `claims.data._deferred_act` is consumed on
//      promotion and `claims.submitted_at` is the promotion. `payload.date` is
//      the door's own stamp and is 360ms off the journal's, so it is not it
//      either. This is named, not papered: `deferred` marks each such line.
//
//   3. `payload` KEY ORDER. Postgres `jsonb` does not preserve object key order;
//      it stores keys sorted by (length, bytes). The drain wrote whatever the
//      door built, in insertion order. For a `voice` payload — `{text, place}` —
//      the two orders coincide by accident. For a `mark` payload they do not.
//      `standing` and `witnesses` ARE recoverable, because their shapes are
//      fixed by `the-witnessed-line` and this module rebuilds them under their
//      own field lists; `payload` is arbitrary and is not. See `PAYLOAD_ORDER`.
//
// ── ONE FACT, TWO PENS: THE NOTARY ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world2/tools/snapshot-export.mjs` already exports `archives/acts/<window>.
// jsonl` from the same rows — frozen on write, certified, 26 windows live at
// 150–175. It is the same acts, in the RAW ROW shape (`id`, `at_anchor`,
// `at_dx`, `at_dy`, `journal_seq`, `inserted_at`), grouped by half-open window
// `(previous closed, N]` rather than by exact crossing value. So the two files
// are one fact written twice in two shapes into two repos. Which one the
// readers should move to is a conductor call and the costing is in the lane
// report; this module does the re-derivation the swap needs TODAY, so that the
// call can be made without the photograph going dark in the meantime.
//
// No env. No clock. No git. The caller supplies the register client, the window,
// the horizon, and the two mappings — because the household resolver lives in
// lane 3's `src/store-writedown.mjs § sketchbookNameFor` and belongs there, not
// in a second copy here.
