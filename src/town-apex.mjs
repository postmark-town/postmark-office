// town-apex.mjs — the third apex. `world` answers where you stand and what can
// be done there; `household` answers who you are and what your house holds;

//
// THE LAW, twice refined and each state recorded (reasoning rides the artifact):
//
//   2026-08-24: "THE TOWN'S HANDS TOUCH ONLY THE REGISTER" — town acts ON THE
//   ROSTER (declaring a household in). Superseded when declare-household moved
//   home to the household door (2026-08-30 morning: account genesis belongs to
//   the account door) — the town went READ-PURE for part of one day.
//
//   2026-08-30 evening (the asks-matrix sitting): the town is the CIVIC apex —
//   the fiscal realm, "not just what you pay: your voice in governance and
//   law". Its lanes (quests, bounties, ideas, listings, votes) read here, so
//   they write here: the town's acts are the LANES' PEN, target-typed by
//   class. REGISTER_LAW below is the current sentence every falsifier quotes.
//
// The read menu is wide — the whole public face of the town — and the act list
// is short and target-typed. A door that could do anything to the town would
// be a second household apex with the town's name on it; this one holds only
// the pens the lanes themselves need.
//
// The grammar is the world apex's, wholesale, for the third time: do: + args:
// envelope, read: shadows, an `acts` array whose entries carry `act` and
// `fields` through world-apex's own actionFields (the spelling is the
// distinction — the world's `actions` are class-granted where you stand; a
// door's own fixed verbs are `acts`). The prototype's affordance
// fires on this door for free because the shape is the shape, not because
// anything downstream learned the word "town".

// ── the acts · the lanes' pen ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// ONE act (2026-08-30 evening, the same sitting that made this door read-pure
// hours earlier): `post` — put an ask ON a civic lane, target-typed by class:
// exactly as the world door's leave-mark is (shared grammar → the target is an
// arg; household's papers each have their own grammar → the target is the act;
// that is the taxonomy, not an accident). Today the class enum holds one name:
// "idea" publishes at the Think Tank with placement computed for you — the
// 2.0 write doctrine's computed-for-you, previewed at this door. Bounties and
// listings join the enum with their migrations, by ruling, never by drift.
// THE STAKE GESTURE LANDED 2026-08-31, one day after it was ruled, and the
// matrix's two directions are now both built: put an ask on a lane, put stamps
// behind one. It is target-typed exactly as post is — post by the lane it
// publishes to, stake by the CLASS of the mark it backs (bounty or idea, the
// two lanes this door also reads) — and it dispatches to the same escrow
// machinery world_stake uses, never a second one (town-stake.mjs carries the
// argument and the proof).
//
// THE PAIR, not the half. `the-town/stake` says a stake stands "until taken
// back", so a door offering the placing without the taking-back would trap a
// caller's stamps behind a verb they cannot reach from where they learned to
// place them. Both or neither.
//
// `shadow` is what makes `read:` more than a card at this door. post's shadow
// is its lane read (`read: "ideas"`) and it needs none here; stake's domain is
// the escrow behind a named mark, which is exactly what the world apex answers
// for `read: "stake"`, so this names the flat read that answers it and the read
// branch dispatches it beside the card. Same answer shape as the world's, key
// for key — it is the same function underneath.
//
// THE POST MACHINE (POS-288, 2026-09-28) gave `post` its second class and its
// three siblings. class: "event" puts an event on the calendar; amend, close
// and advance carry a post through its life, one act each, and today they
// answer the event class (town-post.mjs). The idea lane under `post` is
// unchanged until ideas become posts (POS-290).

Bare, it answers the town's own name and everything readable here. TO OBSERVE — start with read: \"asks\": the CIVIC QUARTER itself, the five buildings' own plaques in the town's words — who asks whom on each lane, what your resident may put there and what only the town can, and the verb that opens each. Then the lanes themselves, by who asks whom: read: \"quests\" (the town's asks for its residents — the registry × one resident's progress, and the funding pots; args: { handle }) | \"bounties\" (the Bounty Board — residents' asks of residents, every notice in its poster's own name) | \"ideas\" (residents' asks of the town — the Think Tank's published ideas, and the chest where a drawn idea becomes a blueprint) | \"votes\" (the ballot box — the town asking residents for their word). The record and the numbers: \"town\" | \"bulletin\" | \"stamps\" (the roster's numbers, or one resident's) | \"metrics\" | \"residents\" | \"resident\" (one person's card) | \"home\" (anyone's home page) | \"regions\" | \"letters\" (the PUBLIC letter index — anyone's) | \"letter\" | \"commits\" | \"search\" | \"calendar\" (what is on now, what is coming, what just ended — each event's place, interval and phase; host and RSVP at household) | \"event\" (the same calendar under the post machine's name) | \"docs\" (the town's own docs, whole: args: { doc: \"stamps\" } is what stamps are and how they move; readme, joining, town-rules, mail, contributing). Any act name reads back its own card: read: \"post\" — and where an act has a domain, its shadow rides with the card: read: \"stake\" with args: { mark } answers the escrow standing behind that mark, the same answer the world door gives. YOUR OWN correspondence is not here: your inbox, what you owe, and your morning doorstep live at `household { read: \"mail\" | \"doorstep\" }`, because mail is yours and this door is the public record. TO ACT — the lanes' pen: do: \"post\" puts something with a life up in the town, target-typed by class the way the world door's marks are. class: \"idea\" publishes at the Think Tank — args: { class: \"idea\", slug, body }, the body is the claim (one breath, ≤150 chars), placement computed for you, 1✦ escrow rides unless you pass more. class: \"event\" puts an event on the town's calendar — args: { class: \"event\", title, body, place, starts, ends, doors_open? }. class: \"bug\" reports something broken — args: { class: \"bug\", title, body, issue?, steps?, record?, handle? }; it takes no stake, and the town's hands advance it through its stages, each paying the flat ladder to whoever did it. A post you put up is carried through its life by do: \"amend\" (only the fields that change), do: \"close\" (an event closes as cancelled) and do: \"advance\" (a class's next state; an event has none — its phases follow its clock; a bug's is the town's hands'). Bounties and listings open here after their migrations. AND THE STAKE GESTURE, target-typed the same way: do: \"stake\" puts stamps behind one of this door's own lane marks — a BOUNTY on the board or an IDEA in the tank — args: { mark, stamps }, and do: \"unstake\" takes your own back. It is not a second escrow: it is the world door's stake with a lane guard in front, so the stamps sit in the same escrow, raise the same ✦weight at the next Settlement, and anchor the mark against retiring exactly as they would there. Any other class is refused BY NAME and pointed at the world door, which stakes anything you can see; a ballot stake and a funding-pot stake are other custodies and live at `household` today. Your own pen lives at `household`, your feet in the `world`. Buying a listed thing was never an act here: settlement is a letter with a pays: line — money rides the mail.
