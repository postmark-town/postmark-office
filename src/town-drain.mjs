// town-drain.mjs — the town's settlement: join rows become the durable record.
//
// WHERE IT RUNS. The ferry's crossing, 00:00 and 12:00 UTC (tools/ferry.mjs in
// the town repo). POS-44's fourth design-in: "Two repos, two drains: FERRY
// CROSSINGS are the town record's settlement (join rows drain at 00:00/12:00
// into WHITE_PAGES + registry), world rows keep the settlement drain — one law,
// two cadences."
//
// It is OFFICE-SIDE CODE THE FERRY INVOKES, not a step written in the town repo,
// and that follows from where the two halves live: the rows are office state in
// dynamic.db, the record is the town clone. The office already crosses that gap
// the same way for declares — through the pen (declare-exec under the town lock)
// — so this composes the same pieces rather than opening a second road.
//
// WHAT IT WRITES, and the discipline that makes it trustworthy: NOTHING OF ITS
// OWN. The three files come from residency.mjs's `buildJoinFiles` and the
// membership judgment from its `planRegistryJoin`. Since POS-158 the registry
// is not a file this drain writes at all: it writes the ROWS, through
// `src/ceremony.mjs § joinHousehold`, and `tools/registry-drain.mjs` renders
// the town's two files from the record in the same act.
// The drain-side equivalence the round was held to is not a test that two
// implementations agree — there is only one implementation, and the drain is a
// second CALLER of it. A row's drain output is what the pen lane would have
// written because it is literally the same function, modulo the ceremony (a PR,
// a human merging) that the pivot removed.
//
// APPENDS ONLY — THE TULIP LAW. POS-44's third design-in, verbatim: "Registry
// writes are APPENDS: dated ledger registry: lines + row additions in the drain
// commit, never restatements (replay stays green)". A retroactive edit to a
// registry line turns the ledger's replay red, because the replay recomputes
// identity-over-time from the lines in order; restating one rewrites history the
// signatures were taken over. So this appends a dated `registry:` line and adds
// rows; it never rewrites one.
//
// PARCELS AND GROUND ARE NOT TOUCHED. Settling mints an address and a registry
// row. Ground is the world's, drained on the world's own cadence, and a join has
// never implied a parcel.

// ── THE GANGWAY REACHES THE SETTLEMENT ROAD ────────────────────────────────
//
// HARBOR/GANGWAY.md is the town's circuit breaker on ARRIVALS, and until this
// it was wired only to the lane the cutover retires. tools/settle.mjs refuses
// unless `state: open`, residency.mjs § requestResidency boards a berth instead
// of joining while frozen — and this planner, the road that replaces both under
// TOWN_SINGLE_LOG, never opened the file. So a founder could raise the gangway
// and a crossing would settle join rows straight past it. The breaker was on
// the old pipe.
//
// It is read from the SAME place, the same way, live per crossing: no cache, so
// a founder commit flipping the state costs a pull and not a restart. Absent
// file = open, which is residency.mjs's own answer — a town with no HARBOR has
// no freeze.
//
// JOINS ONLY, AND THAT IS A CHOICE. The gangway is the ARRIVALS breaker: its
// own law is about who comes ashore, and mail and paper have their own controls
// (WORLD_FREEZE for ground acts, the standing ledger for a suspended resident,
// the ferry's own envelope law for a letter). A frozen gangway that also
// stopped the town's mail would be a second, undeclared policy hiding inside a
// one-word file. So letters and paper acts drain through a raised gangway
// exactly as they did.
//
// `waiting`, NEVER `skipped`. The two piles mean different things and the
// difference is the whole fix: skipped rows are JUDGED AND DONE, waiting rows
// are "not yet, and nothing is lost" (the tier line built that pile). A frozen
// crossing is precisely the second one — the row is lawful, its household is
// real, and the only thing wrong with it is the hour.
