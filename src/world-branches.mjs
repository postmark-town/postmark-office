// and drops it silently. But machinery sweeps AMEND twins (tense arithmetic,
// envelope repairs, relocations), and an amended twin no longer matches its
// ghost — the rebase replays the ghost against its own newer twin, conflicts,
// and bounces the resident's write (#1774, 2026-08-15: all 19 pen branches
// diverged this way after the sweeps; vermillion's marker refused twice).
//
// The remote-tracking ref's reflog is the discriminator: it remembers every
// tip this clone has fetched or pushed. A local-only commit reachable from
// any prior tip WAS on origin — the Settlement has already ruled on that
// history (kept it, amended it, moved it, or removed it), and replaying the
// ghost would fight the ruling. Only a commit the reflog cannot vouch for
// keeps the rebase path so the work replays instead of vanishing — which
// covers the genuinely-precious case (crashed between commit and push) and,
// honestly, also the unprovable ones (no reflog, expired entries); the
// bounce message downstream names both readings instead of asserting one.

// THE FRESHEST published main. `mainRef` prefers the local branch because that

// a box the local branch lags — the tick FETCHES the world clone and never pulls
// (deliberately: a pull would move the pen's checkout mid-write), so local main
// only advances when some resident's walk happens to pull it. Reading engine
// modules off that is reading whatever the last walker left behind.
// ⚑ THIS FUNCTION IS DELIBERATELY NOT MEMOISED, and the first version of the
// party relief memoised it — which broke `freshestMainRef prefers origin/main
// when the local branch lags`, a test that moves the ref and asks again in the
// same breath. That test is right: this reading is a LAW ("the tick fetches and
// never pulls, so origin is the published truth") and a law that answers from
// five seconds ago is not the law.
//
// It costs up to three git subprocesses, and the relief it was blocking is real
// — but the cost belongs to the CALLER that asks per request, not to the
// reading itself. `worldToolModule` is where the memo went instead: it asks
// this once per window rather than once per read, which removes the same
// subprocess storm without touching what the answer means. Fix the caller's
// cadence, not the answer's truth.
//
// ── IT IS ALSO THE CANON READER (2026-09-07, lane-a) ────────────────────────
//
// The sentence above says "for CODE we want the town's published truth". Every
// word of it is true of the world STATE as well, and `publishedState` below did
// not have it: it read `mainRef`, the pen's local-preferring reader, so on the
// box the focus answered from `refs/heads/main` — a ref only the crossing-save's
// 00:02/12:02Z pull advances — six hours after the settlement published. A mark
// the same clone held at `origin/main` came back as "no mark or terrain feature"
// (postmark-town/postmark#2526; the resident walk of 2026-09-06 05:53 EDT).
//
// So this is the ONE published-main ref for every READ tier. `mainRef` stays
// exactly as it is and stays the WRITE path's: a draft forks from the freshest
// local line mid-settlement, which is the case its local preference exists for.
//
// ── THE DIVERGED ARM, AND WHOSE RULING IT IS ────────────────────────────────
//
// `world-serve.mjs § publishedMainSha` ruled on this on 2026-08-17, for the
// as-of bar, in its own words:
//
//   "mainRef()'s local-preference is right for the WRITE paths (a draft forks
//    from the freshest local line mid-settlement) and was wrong here: on
//    2026-08-17 the as-of bar read the lag backwards and reported the store
//    BEHIND a 'main' that was itself two commits stale. The published sha is
//    the DESCENDANT when the two disagree; a truly diverged pair falls to
//    origin, because published truth is what the world can clone."
//
// ⚑ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS COMMENT CLAIMED A DEFECT THAT DID NOT EXIST
// (withdrawn 2026-09-07, reviewer-caught). It said this function "returned the
// LOCAL branch for a diverged pair". It did not. The arm it replaced was
//
//     const behind = Number(git(repo, ["rev-list", "--count",
//       "refs/heads/main..refs/remotes/origin/main"]).trim());
//     return behind > 0 ? "refs/remotes/origin/main" : "refs/heads/main";
//
// and on a diverged pair `LOCAL..ORIGIN` is non-empty, so `behind > 0`, so it
// ALREADY returned origin. I "proved" otherwise by flipping to a paraphrase —
// a bare `return LOCAL` — rather than to the base text, so the red I recorded
// was my own wrong idea of the base failing, not the base. Restoring the base
// arm verbatim and re-running leaves `BOUND · DIVERGED` GREEN, which is the
// measurement that settles it. Measuring the premise is this lane's whole
// charter and this is where I did not.
//
// THE REWRITE IS KEPT, on its real merits and no others: it is a behavioural
// NO-OP in all four ref states, and it is clearer (three named branches instead
// of one count), and it makes the agreement with `publishedMainSha` legible
// rather than coincidental. `test/published-ref-follows-the-settlement.test.mjs`
// binds the two readers across all four states so they cannot drift apart —
// which is a guard worth having whether or not there was ever a bug.
//
// FOUR CALLERS read this function, and the report's first consumer table named
// none of them. Because the arm is a no-op none of their answers changed and no
// different engine code is materialised — but a shared ref-resolver was
// rewritten and its callers went unlisted, which is this lane's own seam rule 1
// failing on this lane's own change:
//   src/world.mjs:101            engineDir()
//   src/dynamic-entities.mjs:107 worldToolModule()
//   src/world2-serve.mjs:97

// ── THE BLESS OVERRIDES THE TICK (Keemin, 2026-09-18; postmark#2934) ─────────
//
// "Shouldn't the bless override the tick?" — yes. The crossing commits its
// candidate to world main and the tick fetches it within fifteen minutes, so
// every read above served a tree the keeper had not yet judged — while the
// viewer, the site, the parcel drain and live claims waited for his tag. Two
// truths; this morning Berthillon's shop at (167, 16) on the doors and
// (221, 95.5) on the map. The model: the candle burns live in the store, the
// clearing at the close LOCKS standing, the sweep materialises the receipt, the
// bless is JUDGMENT on the receipt. The doors' standing follows the last state
// a judgment accepted; the docket is untouched.
//
// So the READ tier's canon ref is no longer main's freshest line but the newest
// `settlement/S<n>` tag, peeled to the commit it blesses. The number counts
// blessings, not beats (`settlements.mjs`): a refused crossing never reaches
// the doors, because nothing is tagged. The pen is untouched — `mainRef()` still
// forks a draft from the freshest local main, because a draft must rebase onto
// what the crossing will actually sweep, not onto what was last blessed.
//
// FALLBACK, said in the answer: a clone with no settlement tag at all (a fresh
// box, a fixture, a shallow clone) serves `freshestMainRef` and reports
// `source: "main"`. Anything else — a tag that will not peel, a `for-each-ref`
// that fails — is the same fallback with the same disclosure, never a throw:
// a read tier that goes dark because a tag is malformed serves nobody.
//
// `candidate_ahead` names main's commit when it is not the blessed one — the
// crossing's candidate the keeper has not (yet) accepted. The header cannot say
// "refused" or "unblessed": a refusal leaves no record the clone can read, and
// "not yet" and "never" look identical from here. It says the sha and lets the
// keeper's tag, or its absence at the next attempt, say which.
//
// NOT MEMOISED, for freshestMainRef's reason above: this is a law, and a law
// that answers from five seconds ago is not the law. One `for-each-ref` spawn
// plus main's resolution; the callers that ask per request already pay
// `publishedState`'s spawns, so the cadence is theirs to fix, not this reading's.
