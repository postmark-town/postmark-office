// stamp-lines.mjs — THE STAMP LEDGER'S CHAIN LIVES IN THE STORE (POS-341, Q1).
//
// Ruled by Darko, 2026-10-04: the signed append-only chain that proves the town's
// economy lives in the store (066, stamp_lines), appended by the pen IN THE SAME
// TRANSACTION as the act that writes it, and the town repo's
// WHITE_PAGES/stamp-ledger.md becomes its signed public export. This file is the
// writer, the reader and the verifier.
//
// ── THE PEN'S TRANSACTION ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every ledger line is still signed by the town's own engine (appendSigned, the
// CLIs, the mint runner) into the clone's file under the town lock. What changes
// is the commit: `stampedCommit` opens ONE store transaction, records every line
// the file now holds past the store's last row (each one's seal recomputed and
// its signature verified), then runs the pen's git ceremony inside it. Git
// refuses (a push that can't land, a commit that fails), and the transaction
// rolls back with it: the store never holds a line the export lost. The store
// refuses (a forged or unsigned line, a changed past), and the commit never
// runs. The one window left is a git landing whose COMMIT then fails, which
// leaves the store BEHIND its export; the next stamped write or
// `stamp-lines.mjs --sync` records those lines (the store reads git), and the
// verifier says so until it does.
//
// ── THE SWITCH ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `STAMP_LINES=store` turns the store write on. Unset, `stampedCommit` is the
// plain pen commit, exactly as before 066, and the rollback is unsetting it.
// Apply 066 before setting it.
//
// ── ONE ROW VOUCHES FOR THE WHOLE PAST ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// A line's signature is over its seal, and a seal is sha256(previous seal +
// canonical) from the town's genesis. So a file whose line N carries the same
// canonical and signature as the store's row N has the same N lines the store
// has, and only the lines after it are new. The verifier still walks the whole
// chain; the writer needs one row.
