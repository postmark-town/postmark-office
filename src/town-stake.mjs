// town-stake.mjs — the town door's stake verbs (`town { do: "stake" | "unstake" }`).
//
// Append-shaped on purpose, the discipline world-stake.mjs set: a NEW module, so
// the shared files gain only imports, three tool definitions and three switch
// cases. Several lanes are open on this repo today and the surface each one
// touches is kept as small as it can be.
//
// ── ONE OWNER FOR ESCROW, AND THIS FILE IS NOT IT ───────────────────────────
//
// Everything about what a stake IS lives elsewhere and is reached, never
// reimplemented:
//
//   the law            `the-town/stake` (v2) and `the-town/stake-mark` (v1) in
//                      the world record — subject: resident, object: mark.
//   the ledger         the TOWN clone's own tools/world-stake.mjs — the clip,
//                      the balance, the signed append, the retirement gate.
//   the door's gates   src/world-stake.mjs — identity, mark existence, the
//                      ferry's flock, the draft promotion, the freeze.
//
// So these verbs are THIN WRAPPERS over `worldStakeViaOffice` /
// `worldUnstakeViaOffice` / `worldStakeRead`, and the thinness is the whole
// design. What this file adds is exactly one thing the world door cannot add
// and should not: the LANE GUARD. The town door serves the town's own civic
// lanes, so its stake act is target-typed by class — bounty or idea — and
// refuses every other class BY NAME, teaching that the world door stakes
// anything you can see. Every other rule, every bounce, every number is the
// world door's own sentence, spoken once.
//
// THE PROOF THAT IT IS ONE OWNER, and it is checkable rather than asserted: the
// stake reaches the ledger through the same `worldStakeViaOffice`, which writes
// `via: "api"` on the row, so the ledger line a town-door stake produces —
//
//     - <date> · <handle> → stake:world-mark/<mark> · <n> · via: api
//
// — is byte-identical to the one the world door produces. `foldWorldMarkPositions`
// and the escrow fold key on kind/mark/handle/n and nothing else; `via` is read
// only for BALLOT stakes, to dedupe mail-carried ones. No consumer of mark escrow
// anywhere — settlement, retirement, forecast, portfolio, the site's board —
// can tell which door a stake came through, because there is nothing in the
// record for them to tell it by. That is not a convention this file keeps; it is
// a fact about the row, and the falsifiers pin it.
//
// ── WHY THE PAIR, NOT JUST STAKE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `the-town/stake`, verbatim: "A stake is ✦ held in escrow behind a mark —
// belief with weight, standing until taken back, and the record keeps both the
// placing and the withdrawal." A door that offered the placing without the
// taking-back would be offering half a class — and worse than half, because the
// half it withheld is the one that returns a resident's stamps. Escrow placed
// at a door with no matching release is escrow trapped for anyone who only
// knows that door. The pair ships together.

 * and never by drift.
 *
 * CLASS, NOT GROUND, and the distinction is deliberate. `bountyBoard` requires
 * both class AND the board's ground, because a listing read answers "what is
 * standing here" and the ground is half of that answer. Staking asks a
 * different question — "may I put stamps behind this thing" — and the class
 * mark types it by class alone (`subject: resident, object: mark`). A bounty
 * the worldkeeper tidied off the board is still a bounty and its backers are
 * still its backers; refusing it here would make a housekeeping move into a
 * custody rule. The falsifiers pin this on purpose, so a later hand that
 * "completes" the guard with a ground check fails out loud.
