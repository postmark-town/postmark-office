// bugs.mjs — THE BUG CLASS OF THE POST MACHINE (Posts phase 2, first slice), pure.
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-29 (the Posts project, § Ruled for phase 2): "Bugs pay the
// flat ladder, with no staking … it feels odd to wait for stakers for a clearly
// broken thing that just needs fixing, and ideally every bug gets fixed
// anyway." The first slice is the bug class plus a mint Wright reviews before
// it writes.
//
// ── THE LIFECYCLE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   reported → confirmed → reproduced → diagnosed → briefed → fixed → shipped
//
// with two side exits from reported or confirmed: `duplicate` (naming the post
// it duplicates, `of`) and `not-a-bug`. Finished: shipped, duplicate, not-a-bug.
//
// Any resident posts a bug as themselves. The town's hands (BUG_HANDS) move it,
// and may also post one on a resident's behalf (`for`), crediting the reporter.
// An advance may jump forward; a stage it skips pays nothing.
//
// ── THE ADVANCE RECORDS; IT MINTS NOTHING ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Each advance act names the stage and whom it credits (`credit`), and at
// `briefed` the grade, at `fixed` the size and the critter the fixer named
// (POS-298; kept as fields.critter with fields.named_by). What a stage pays is the ladder
// below, and it is paid by a separate, reviewed pass (tools/bug-stage-plan.mjs)
// that reads these acts, so a door call never moves money. The town's own
// ledger holds the ladder again at verify (its stamp-mint.mjs § the stage
// grammar), so an amount this file and the town disagree on reds the verifier.
//
// ── NO STAKE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A bug takes no stake, at post and at the stake door alike, refused by name
// (BUG_NO_STAKE), with the ruling's reason in the refusal.
