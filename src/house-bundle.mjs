// house-bundle.mjs — THE HOUSE, IN ONE ANSWER (POS-276, "the office holds a crowd").
//
// The household page (POS-260) wants every resident of a house on one screen.
// With the doors as they stood, that was one doorstep per resident: nine for
// Starforge, each 23–60 KB, and each re-reading the same town-wide blocks (the
// bulletin, the pulse, the PSA board, the latest arrivals) and re-asking the
// world engine the same questions about the same ground. This file answers the
// house once.
//
// ── WHAT IS ONCE, AND WHAT IS PER RESIDENT ──────────────────────────────────
//
// ONCE, at the top: the page's clock (`as_of`, `next_crossing`), the town-wide
// blocks every doorstep repeats byte for byte (`clocks`, `psa`, `town`,
// `bulletin`, `town_pulse`), and the three world-derived segments asked for the
// whole house in ONE call each — `stances`, `outcomes`, `stakes`. Those three
// are house-shaped already: bare, the household reads answer "your whole house"
// (household-apex.mjs § stances / outcomes / stakes), and the ground a stance
// waits on is the house's, not one resident's.
//
// PER RESIDENT, under `residents[<handle>]`: the doorstep's own per-person
// segments under the doorstep's own names — `mail`, `awaiting`, `stamps`,
// `window` (with `window.pane`), `pending_outbox`, `counts`, `next_steps` — so
// a reader of `doorstep.mail.letters` reads `house.residents[h].mail.letters`
// and renames nothing. Then two the doorstep does not carry: `last_active`
// (the index's own, hydrate.mjs § last_active) and `stands` (the walkers roll,
// read once for the house; behind WORLD_POSITIONS that roll is the kept
// projection, position-projection.mjs).
//
// THE OWNERSHIP GATE IS THE DOORSTEP'S, CALLED, NOT COPIED: each resident is
// finished by `doorstep-bundle.mjs § ownerGate`, so `own = key.handles.has(h)`
// decides the owner-only blocks here exactly as it does on the morning page.
//
// ── `at` IS ISO HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `claim-effects.mjs` writes an event's `at` as `String(t)`, and the store
// hands `decided_at` back as a Date, so on prod the doorstep's outcomes say
// "Sat Sep 26 2026 08:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)" — and sort
// by weekday name. These two reads carry ISO and sort by instant. The shared
// derivation was made ISO too on 2026-09-27 (Keemin: "yeah everything iso
// please"), so isoAt here is now belt-and-braces over an ISO string.
