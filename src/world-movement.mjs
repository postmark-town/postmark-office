// world-movement.mjs — STAGE D, the movement cutover. All of it behind
// `WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2=1`; with the flag off nothing in this file runs and every
// door answers byte-for-byte what it answered before.
//
// Three sentences from the proposal become code here, and each one replaces a
// derivation the office had been doing for itself:
//
//   1. A CARRIER'S POSITION IS f(TIMETABLE, CLOCK). Not a walk-ledger line that
//      the pen files on her behalf at cast-off. `tools/vessel.mjs` has held this
//      arithmetic since 2026-08-07 and the office never consumed it — it read
//      her sailing line out of the ledger like a resident's and compared
//      passengers against it field by field (`ridesTheVessel`). That comparison
//      is the line-mirroring being retired: true only for as long as the pen
//      keeps filing passengers with byte-identical records, which is a
//      coincidence of the writer, not a fact about the world.
//
//   2. RIDING IS A FRAME, NOT A DECLARATION (ruled 2026-08-10, and it REPLACES
//      this file's first answer). An earlier build asked residents to say "I am
//      aboard" and validated the claim against where they stood at the cast-off
//      instant. The frame law deletes all of it: your frame is the deepest
//      carrier you are within, crossing the boundary is the consent, and there
//      is no cast-off instant to be present at — you are carried if your frame
//      is the carrier when it moves. The machinery lives in `world-frames.mjs`;
//      this file is where the doors reach it.
//
//   3. AN EMISSION RIDES ITS SOURCE. A voice's frame is its speaker; a speaker's
//      frame may be a carrier; FRAMES COMPOSE. A shared deck is one room by
//      construction — see `heardFromV2`, and the INTERIM block in voices.mjs it
//      supersedes. This generalized for free when attachments became frames,
//      which is the sign the law was the right size.
//
// THE ENGINE COMES FROM A REF, NOT THE WORKING TREE. Same discipline (and the
// same helper) as `dynamic-entities.mjs`: the world clone's checkout belongs to
// the write pen and routinely sits on a household draft branch, so importing
// movement arithmetic from the tree would mean the office computed where the
// boat is from whatever the last writer left behind.

// The frame law above still decides where you stand when you LEAVE a thing that
// carries things — a keystone riding a house, a held lantern riding its holder,

//
// The frame law's answer to "is this resident aboard" is `foldFrames`: your
// endpoint at arrival landed inside her footprint. Keemin's ruling 1 —
// "decouple the geometric movement of the Post Office from the residents'
// ability to ride it" — makes that answer unreachable for a rider by
// construction: you enter through a wharf a hundred kilometres from her hull,
// your walk record ends at that wharf, and no fold over your departures will
// ever put you inside her. So the question moves to the record that actually
// knows: the enter-exit ledger, which is the office's one answer to "what are
// you inside" and has been since the pair shipped.
//
//   "wherever a resident boards … they can take it to their destination at Post
//    Office speed as if it was going directly there"
//   "we need the residents sitting still in a Post Office interior"
//
// So: your standpoint IS the hull's, you are not moving (nothing you declared is
// in progress — the timer is not a leg), and THERE IS NO INTERPOLATION TOWARD
// THE DESTINATION. That last one is not an omission; it is ruling 6 falling out
// of one branch. A lobby has no intermediate points.

// enter class): "You occupy a mark only by entering, and only while your feet
// stand inside it; a walk that would carry you out is refused until you exit."
// Occupancy implies geometry, never the reverse. The founder's words: "prevent
// walking out of the geometry of a mark without exiting … and make enter
// voluntary even if you're technically standing in a geometric region."
//
// Pure: given the resident's occupancy stack (outermost first, innermost last —
// enter-exit.mjs § occupancyAt's own order), the destination point, and the
// clone's own point-in-mark test, answer the marks the walk would carry the
// occupant OUT of, innermost first. Empty = the walk is lawful as it stands.
// A walk INTO a footprint never enters (R15: "walk … NEVER implies entry") — so
// only the leaving direction is guarded, which is exactly the asymmetry ruled.
