// roles.mjs — the role registry: who the office lets through a gated door.
//
// The first primitive of the SUBSCRIPTION lane, which sits BESIDE the stamps /
// holo ownership economy and does not touch it. A role is not a holding, not a
// deed, not a stamp: it is a line in an operator-kept book saying this
// household may pass. Purely db-based, hand-kept, one whitelist to start.
//
// ── THE SUBJECT IS THE GH_ID. THE LOGIN IS DECORATION ──────────────────────
//
// Founder-ruled twice, and the second ruling corrected the first. Roles key to
// the HOUSEHOLD, never to a resident handle and never to a session — one human
// subscribes, every resident of their house inherits it. But the household's
// *identifier* is `gh_id`, the immutable GitHub numeric account id, NOT the
// login: "we should 100% use gh_id as primary key for everything."
//
// WHY THE FIRST SHAPE WAS WRONG. `oauth.mjs § householdFor` answers
// `household: ghLogin ?? String(ghId)` — the login, because the `??` only
// reaches the id when the login is absent, which for a signed-in account is
// never. A GitHub login is MUTABLE: a user renames their account and the string
// changes. Keying a paid role on it means a rename silently revokes what
// somebody paid for, with no error, no audit line, and nothing for the resident
// to point at. Handles survive a rename (they resolve through pinned numeric
// ids); the household string does not.
//
// THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. The town's own `tools/github-ids.json` carries two
// residents whose records read `"renamed": "2026-07-31 (github login rename; id
// unchanged)"` — `alden` and `corwin`, both now logged in as `fox-hearth`.
// They survived exactly because they were pinned BY ID. A login-keyed registry
// would have dropped them.
//
// So `subject` is the gh_id, canonicalised to a digit string (see
// `normalizeSubject`), and `login` is a display column beside it — written on
// grant, refreshed on sight, and NEVER read to decide anything. The rule in one
// line: **an identifier a human can change is a label, not a key.**
//
// The gate therefore reads `key.ghId`, which oauth.mjs already puts on every
// credential shape it verifies (`oauthLookup`, `keyLookup`, and the co-signed
// `berthLookup` all spread `{ ghId, ghLogin }`). A caller with no verified
// GitHub identity — a bare berth, or a static key row with no gh_id — has
// no subject and can hold no role. See `static-keys.mjs` for how an operator
// pins one (the `#<gh_id>` of the OFFICE_KEYS entry the row was imported from).
//
// ── THE BOUNDARY, WHICH IS STRUCTURAL AND NOT A PROMISE ────────────────────
//
// Roles live AT THE DOOR. The world's response function, the world derivation,
// and everything in the `postmark-world` package are roles-blind, and the
// structure — not anyone's discipline — is what enforces it:
//
//   `postmark-world` is a SEPARATE REPOSITORY, cloned at WORLD_CLONE. The
//   dependency edge runs office -> clone and only that way: `world.mjs`'s
//   `engineDir()` reads the clone's `tools/` subtree at a published sha and
//   imports the engine FROM it. Nothing in the clone can import
//   `postmark-office/src/`; there is no path, no package entry, no resolution
//   root that reaches back. A module in this directory is therefore unreachable
//   from world evaluation by construction, the same way it is unreachable from
//   any other repository on the machine.
//
// What discipline still owns is the office's OWN world-facing half — the
// `src/world*.mjs` modules that compose world reads. Those could import this
// file, so a falsifier asserts they do not (test/roles.test.mjs § THE
// BOUNDARY), and it is written to fail if anyone ever wires one up.
//
// ── THE STATE AND THE RECEIPT ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two tables, and the split is the design: `roles` is the STATE (what is true
// now — a revoke deletes the row) and `role_audit` is the RECEIPT (what
// happened — append-only, a revoke ADDS to it and never removes). Reading the
// gate costs one indexed lookup against the small table; reconstructing how a
// household got its standing costs a scan of the long one.
//
// ⚑ DURABILITY, NAMED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. `roles.db` is its own file beside
// `oauth.db` and `dynamic.db`, and `*.db` is gitignored, so it lives on the box
// and nowhere else. It is NOT the same durability class as its neighbours, and
// the difference matters: `office.db` and `world.db` are pure indexes, deleted
// and rebuilt whole from a clone; `oauth.db` is auth paperwork whose loss only
// forces everyone to sign in again; `dynamic.db` carries an explicit covenant
// that every row re-derives or recovers from a crossing-save. This file carries
// NO such covenant, because a grant exists nowhere else in the world — no repo
// holds it, no fold recomputes it. Losing roles.db loses who paid. The audit
// table is what a restore would be rebuilt FROM, which is the strongest reason
// it is append-only; a backup discipline for this one file is an operations
// decision that is not this module's to make, only to state.
//
// ⚑ AND SINCE POS-271 IT HAS ONE: the store. Every function below takes a
// paper (paperwork.mjs) as `rdb` — roles.db by default, the store's
// office_roles / office_role_audit once the office is switched
// (OFFICE_PAPERWORK_STORE=1) — so every one of them is async. The store is
// backed up with everything else in it (deploy/world2-backup.sh), which is the
// durability this file could only name.

// The office root has a home — `world-store.mjs § OFFICE_ROOT` — and the
// one-home rule would normally say import it. It is re-derived here instead,
// and the duplication is the cheaper of two costs: importing the WORLD's store
// module to learn a filesystem path would give the role registry a live edge
// into world code, which is the exact edge this module's whole boundary claim
// says does not exist. A reader auditing that claim should not have to work out
// that the import was only for a constant. What is duplicated is one line of
// repo layout, not a domain constant, and `test/roles.test.mjs § THE BOUNDARY,
// the other half` pins the import list so this cannot quietly regrow.
