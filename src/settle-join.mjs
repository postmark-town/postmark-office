// settle-join.mjs — the Registrar settles a merged pen join (town #3231).
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-28, postmark-town/postmark#3231): the join PR stays a
// REQUEST and never again carries edits to the pins or households files; the
// database is the one writer. The Registrar settles merged pen joins as part
// of her audit, through one narrow office door:
//
//   household { do: "settle-join", args: { handle } }
//
// WHY THIS DOOR EXISTS. Since POS-158 the pen's join PR carries only the
// address, and the pin and the membership were meant to land at the crossing
// that follows the merge. No path writes them for a PR join: the residency
// door logs no town-journal row (none of `requestResidency`'s callers passes
// `{ odb }`), and the town drain skips a handle whose ADDRESS already stands
// (`src/town-drain.mjs`, "already stands in the white pages"). Wildcat (#3217)
// was bound by hand on 2026-09-28. This door is the hand, named.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, and each refusal is its own sentence (`SETTLE_REFUSALS`):
//   · the caller's key holds one of `SETTLE_JOIN_CALLERS` (checked at the
//     household apex, which answers anyone else as it answers an act it has
//     never heard of — the door is unlisted and does not advertise itself);
//   · the handle has no pin in the record yet (a pinned handle answers
//     "already settled" and nothing is written — the idempotent re-call);
//   · its join PR was opened by the office pen from `residency/<handle>` and
//     is MERGED;
//   · the PR body carries the pen's verified-identity block;
//   · the handle has an ADDRESS on town main (read under the lock, after the
//     pull — the office clone lags its pull cron, so a join the Registrar has
//     just merged must not be refused off a stale clone);
//   · the card's `household:` names a house in the record whose accounts
//     already include the verified id. That is the vouch, re-checked NOW
//     against the record, never trusted from the PR. An account the house
//     never listed is a person's call, and the door refuses it.
//
// THE ACT IS THE CEREMONY ITSELF: `joinHousehold` (src/ceremony.mjs), under
// the town lock the way `src/declare-exec.mjs` runs it. The pin and the
// membership land in one act, and the registry drain re-renders
// `tools/github-ids.json` and `tools/households.json` from the record in one
// pen commit. The door never writes either file by hand.
//
// AMENDED (Keemin, 2026-09-29, Household Primary Key reopened): the office
// decides whatever a machine can decide. So the office tick runs this after
// every merge (deploy/settle-pass.mjs, before the join-bundle pass), which
// overturns the "no timer" clause above; and a HAND-WRITTEN join PR settles
// too, keyed by its author's GitHub id (the API's `user.id`, never the card),
// with the card's `github:` resolving to that same id:
//   · an account already on a house → that house;
//   · an unknown account whose card names no existing house → a house is
//     minted, as the pen road does;
//   · a card naming an existing house the account is not on → refused, a
//     person's call.
// And NOTHING THE LEDGER ALREADY KNOWS UNBOUND IS BOUND HERE: a pin re-keys a
// handle's ledger lines from genesis, and for Wildcat that put two welcome
// lines in one house and stopped every office write (2026-09-28).
