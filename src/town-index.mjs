// town-index.mjs — THE ONE DERIVATION of the office's town index (POS-268).
//
// Everything office.db holds is derived here, from a town checkout, as plain
// rows in office.db's own column order. Two writers take these rows and never
// derive anything themselves:
//
//   src/hydrate.mjs                       writes them into office.db (sqlite),
//                                         as it always has
//   world2/tools/town-index-ingest.mjs    writes them into the store's town_*
//                                         tables: whole once at the seed, then
//                                         only the rows a delta changed
//
// So "the store equals office.db" is a claim about the two WRITERS, never about
// two derivations that drifted. The rules themselves are not restated here:
// they are the town's own exported folds (mail-state, stamp-mint,
// quest-progress), the vendored `readTown`, and the office's own readers
// (residency, profiles, panes, funding, quest-standing), exactly as hydrate.mjs
// called them before this file existed. The move is a cut and paste; the only
// new code is the shape the pieces return in.
//
// The pieces are separate on purpose: a delta re-derives only the tables its
// commits touched, and `mailStateRows` takes the handles to recompute (the town's
// `mailState` walks every letter once per resident: 10 s of the 14 s a whole
// derivation costs at 213 residents, docs/town-index-store.md).
