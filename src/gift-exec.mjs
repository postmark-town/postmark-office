// town.lock`, the same lock the ferry chain holds — a gift can never race a
// crossing). Does the whole critical section in one process: pull the clone,
// catch the ledger up (--append), mint the gift (--gift) through the town's OWN
// stamp-mint CLI (the single mint law — all its paranoia rides free), commit +
// push the sealed ledger with the pen's ceremony, read back the recipient's new
// balance. Prints exactly one JSON line.
//
// Env: TOWN_CLONE, STAMP_KEY (path to the pen's ed25519 pem), TOWN_PUSH=1,
//      BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's), TOWN_TZ.
// argv[2]: JSON { handle, amount, slug, by, date }.
//
// Exit 0 with { line, handle, amount, slug, by, date, balance, commit } or
// { error: { code, defect, hint } } (a bounce is an answer); exit 1 only when
// the machinery itself trips.
