// read-workers.mjs — reads answered on the other cores, writes kept on one
// thread (POS-266, "the office holds a crowd").
//
// ── THE SHAPE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The box has four cores and the office used one. On the Snug Harbour night a
// single read (/world/settlements, /world/present) held the one thread for
// seconds, and every caller behind it waited, the letters included. So:
//
//   - THE MAIN THREAD keeps the port, every write, the admission (the bouncer's
//     buckets are its RAM), the telemetry line, and every read whose answer
//     lives in its own memory (MAIN_ONLY_READS below).
//   - N READ WORKERS (worker_threads, N = cores − 1, OFFICE_READ_WORKERS to
//     tune, 0 to switch off) each run the SAME server module as a read-role
//     office (`role.mjs`: sqlite read-only, no pen, the unsafe doors refused by
//     name) that never listens. The main thread hands a worker a read after it
//     has admitted it, and writes the worker's answer back on its own socket.
//
// Each worker holds its own caches: it is a fresh module graph. Most of them
// are keyed on a stamp the worker reads itself (a file's mtime, a ref file, a
// table's count), and those need nothing from here. The ones a WRITE on the
// main thread moves in memory are told by a message — `announce(kind, payload)`
// on the main thread, `onAnnounce(kind, fn)` in the module that owns the cache.
// Messages and requests to one worker ride ONE port, and a port delivers in
// order, so a read handed over after a write's announcement is answered after
// the worker has applied it. That is the whole freshness guarantee: no read on a
// worker is older than the write that preceded it by more than that one hop.
// The inventory of every cache and how its worker learns it moved is in
// docs/read-workers.md.
//
// ── WHY THREADS AND NOT DEC-4's PROCESSES ────────────────────────────────────
//
// DEC-4 (2026-09-08) proposed three read PROCESSES behind nginx, and its kit
// (deploy/postmark-office-read@.service, nginx-postmark-read-pool*.conf) was
// never applied. A process cannot be told what moved: since POS-264 the
// positions projection is RAM on the writer, fed by its walk door, and a read
// process would answer walkers from a projection up to PROJECTION_MAX_AGE_MS
// old. The worker keeps DEC-4's three refusals (it boots as `--role read`), and
// replaces its transport.
