// position-snapshot.mjs — THE DEPARTURE RECORD'S SNAPSHOT PER CLEARING, AND THE
// DELTA SINCE (POS-302, the first instance of POS-277).
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-27: "let's aim to have essentially everything snapshotted per
// settlement/clearing, and only live compute the delta between settlement
// snapshots." Every reader of "where is everyone" reduced the WHOLE departure
// record to one record per handle: the positions projection at boot and every
// 60 s, and the 2.0 endpoints (`/world2/positions`, `/world2/present`) on every
// request. This file is the two halves of doing that once per clearing instead:
//
//   buildSnapshot(actRows)   every departure act, both eras, in DEPARTURE_ORDER,
//                            reduced to each handle's governing record (in
//                            `departureRecords`' shape) with its first-appearance
//                            ordinal, plus the per-era census and the cut's key.
//   composeSnapshot(...)     a kept snapshot plus the acts after it, as the list
//                            `governingOf` reduces exactly as it reduces the
//                            whole record, with the census the whole record
//                            would give — or a DISCARD with its reason.
//   snapshotRead(client)     the one read of a snapshot, its recount and delta.
//
// No connection of its own, no transaction, no clock.
//
// ── ERA ONE IS THE STORE'S `_ledger` ROWS (Wright, 2026-10-02) ───────────────
//
// Era one had two owners: the git walk ledger (the projection) and the store's
// `_ledger` rows (the 2.0 endpoints). Git reads are what is being retired, so a
// snapshot holds the store's `_ledger` rows like any other era, and nothing that
// reads a snapshot reads git. The backfill carried only the ledger lines older
// than the journal's first row (the rest were journal rows already), so the
// store's era one equals the git ledger only together with the store's other
// eras; test/era-one-from-the-store.test.mjs holds that, and the writer refuses
// to write a snapshot over a store where it does not hold
// (world2/tools/position-snapshot.mjs § compareEraOne).
//
// ── WHY IT IS EXACT (and the two cases where it would not be) ────────────────
//
// `governingOf` keeps each handle's LAST record at its FIRST position. The
// snapshot keeps both per handle, so replaying its records in ordinal order and
// then the delta in order lands every handle at the same place with the same
// record — PROVIDED the delta is everything after the snapshot in the record's
// own order. Two things break that, and each is checked, never assumed:
//
//   LATE UNDER A LOWER ID. `acts.id` is drawn before the row commits, so a row
//   can appear under an id the snapshot already passed. The count at id <= hw
//   moves, and the snapshot is discarded.
//   SORTS INSIDE THE SNAPSHOT. The order is (era, instant, id), ruled
//   2026-09-21 (live-reads.mjs § THE INSTANT KEY), so a backfilled act with an
//   early instant and a late id belongs INSIDE the snapshot's span. Every delta
//   row must sort after the snapshot's last key, or the snapshot is discarded.
//
// A discarded snapshot is not an error: the full derivation serves and the read
// says so (Keemin, 2026-10-02: the full derivation wins, disclosed).
//
// ── THE ERA-ORDER OVERLAP IS KEPT, NOT RE-COUNTED ────────────────────────────
//
// The projection discloses `era-order-overlap: N store record(s) predate the
// newest ledger line` (prod: 12 on 2026-10-02, the journal's copies of the
// ledger's last lines). The ledger is frozen and those rows never leave, so the
// writer counts them once against the ledger's newest instant and the snapshot
// keeps both; a read adds the delta's own and says the same number.
