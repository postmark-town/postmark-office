// quests.mjs — THE QUEST CLASS OF THE POST MACHINE (POS-294), pure.
//
// Keemin, 2026-09-28: "All quests are technically posts. They are the town's
// posts. Even standing quests. They are the town's way of saying 'we want you
// sending thoughtful letters to one another'."
//
// The Posts project, § Ruled for phase 1:
//   · quest: open → closed; only the town posts and closes. A standing quest
//     stays open until retired, its progress derived from the letters, and
//     only its reward mint recorded. Finished: closed.
//   · A town post's author is `postmark-pen`, household `hh:the-town` ("the
//     founder (DARKO) answers for its pen"). The act records whose hand
//     posted, amended or closed it.
//
// ── ONE ROW PER QUEST, POINTING AT ITS REGISTRY ENTRY ───────────────────────
//
// The town's quest-registry.json stays the source of a quest's terms (title,
// source, reward, cadence, target). The post row carries `fields.quest`, the
// registry id, and the read joins the terms from the registry at read time,
// so a registry edit is on the next read and never a second copy to keep in
// step. The row's own title and body are what the registry said when it was
// posted: the act's record of what was put up, not the terms.
//
// Progress is not here. It stays derived from the letters (the town's
// tools/quest-progress.mjs), and the reward mint stays the stamp ledger's, so
// nothing about a quest's progress is stored.
//
// ── NOT EVERY REGISTRY ROW ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The `ongoing` rows are the funding pots (darko-fund, keeping-ec2). Pots
// becoming quests is POS-291, after the September close; this class refuses
// them by name.
