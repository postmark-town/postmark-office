// world2-serve.mjs — the door's WORLD 2.0 READ TIER (dev era).
//
// Phase 3c of the gold plan: the reads the site will consume, served straight
// from Postgres — freshness as a QUERY, not a pipeline (the staleness-sentinel
// class dies here, gold §2). Keyless like the 1.0 world read tier: the docket,
// standing marks, and window receipts are all public facts — the docket being
// PUBLIC is half the candle's point ("here is everything that locks at 17:45").
//
// Namespaced under /world2/* so nothing shadows a 1.0 route during the shadow
// era; at cutover these become the /world reads (and the bake pipeline dies).
// Role: the same office_api connection the shadow pens hold (SELECT is granted
// on everything).
//
// The placed/standing split (the seed lane's read-path note, resolved here):
//   /world2/marks          -> placed marks only (they have a where) — the map's read
//   /world2/marks?all=true -> the whole standing register incl. de-sited
//   A de-sited mark IS standing; a consumer that wants a `where` on every row
//   asks for the default.
//
// ── THE LIVE LANE (A/B gaps P-092 / P-093 / P-098 / P-036) ──────────────────
//
// /world2/walks · /world2/positions · /world2/present · /world2/say ·
// /world2/occupancy answer the questions the apex read shadows still answer out
// of sqlite. Every derivation is `world2/tools/live-reads.mjs` — 1.0's own law,
// ported, and held to the original by `falsifier-live-equality.mjs`. Nothing in
// THIS file derives anything: it queries, orders, and renders.
//
// Two shapes are load-bearing and easy to get wrong from here:
//
//   · the ORDER. Departure and passage reads MUST carry
//     `live-reads.DEPARTURE_ORDER_SQL`. `ORDER BY id` is silently wrong — the
//     backfill inserted the pre-journal era last, so 44 of 73 residents would
//     be handed a governing leg from July. `departureRecords` asserts it.
//   · the CLOCK. `?at=<ISO>` evaluates the whole answer at that instant; absent,
//     it is now. Position is a function of (record, clock) and nothing between
//     is stored, so any instant is answerable and none is cached.
//
// Keyless, like the rest of this tier and like 1.0's own equivalents:
// `world_walkers` is in mcp.mjs's PUBLIC set, and server.mjs serves
// GET /world/present keyless. These are public facts about a public town.

// ── THE ENGINE, AND WHY IT IS THE ONE THING NOT IN THE STORE ────────────────
//
// Every other read in this file is bytes: query, order, render. `/world2/apex`
// is the exception and the exception is deliberate. Its `within` is a
// CONTAINMENT CHAIN and its `nearby` is a FIELD OF VIEW — occlusion, fog,
// light, LOD ranking against the context budget. That is `world-verbs.mjs` +
// `world-engine.mjs`, and gold §"What is NOT slop" keeps it: *"the engine
// (verbs, geometry, adjudication) survives unchanged in spirit."* Phase 3 says
// how: *"the engine's verbs/geometry/adjudication port as pure functions over
// queries."* Those functions are ALREADY pure over a `world` object, so the
// port is the ASSEMBLY — `apex-reads.mjs` builds the world out of `marks` +
// `law_projection` rows, and the engine's own judgment runs over it.
//
// Loaded THE SAME WAY src/world.mjs loads it — from a published ref, never the
// working tree — because the clone's tree belongs to the write pen and a draft
// exec parks it on a household branch. `dynamic-entities.mjs` takes the same
// route for the same reason.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS A LIVE CHECKOUT DEPENDENCY IN A TIER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE NONE,
// and it is the one open seam of this door. The 2.0 read tier "answers from
// Postgres and holds no world checkout" (this file's own header); at cutover
// the engine must arrive as a published package or a vendored subtree instead.
// Said here, in the code, rather than only in a report: an office with no clone
// gets `engine_unavailable` and the door BOUNCES 503 rather than answering a
// spine it could not compute. A wrong `within` is worse than no `within` — it

  //
  // `GET /world/settlements` out of the `settlements` table instead of out of
  // the world clone's tags. Keyless, exactly as 1.0 is: which settlements have
  // landed is the most public fact the town has.
  //
  // THE DECISIONS ARE 1.0'S OWN, IMPORTED. `settlementsFrom` is the pure half
  // of `src/settlements.mjs` — which rows count, ordered by NUMBER and never by
  // date or by the order the store hands them over, `current` = the highest
  // number that landed, a gap left as the refusal it was, and the recent-list
  // cap. The store rows are rendered into the exact `{tag, sha, date}` lines
  // `readSettlementTags` produces from git, and handed to the same function, so
  // a changed rule moves both doors or neither. Nothing here decides anything.
  //
  // TWO REPRESENTATIONS DIFFER FROM 1.0 AND BOTH ARE SAID HERE:
  //   · `sha` is the WHOLE commit sha. 1.0 prints `rev-parse --short`, whose
  //     length is git's auto-abbreviation for the clone at hand (8 today) —
  //     a value that grows with the repo. The store keeps the commit whole and
  //     the twin serves it whole; 1.0's short is a prefix of it, always.
  //   · `date` is the same INSTANT rendered in UTC, `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. 1.0
  //     prints `%cI` in the COMMITTER's own offset — `-04:00` for the 37
  //     keeper-era tags (S1–S43, committed from an EDT machine), `Z` for the 34
  //     box-era ones. A timestamptz keeps the instant and not the offset. No
  //     day boundary moves: the latest EDT commit of any day is 16:08.
  //
  // WHAT THE STORE CARRIES THAT THE TAG LIST CANNOT is on each row beside 1.0's
  // three fields: `window` (the candle window that crossing closed; null for
  // every tag older than the store's first window) and `blessed_at` (the tag
  // object's own date — the keeper's bless, which 1.0 conflates with the push).
  //
  // FRESHNESS NAMES ITS SOURCE. A row exists once `settlements-backfill.mjs
  // --apply` ran after the tag landed, and the office's tick runs it every
  // 15 minutes right after the world fetch that carries the tag in
  // (deploy/office-tick.sh § settlements-on-tick, Wright-ruled 2026-09-17 on

/**
 * `present`, in the apex's own shape.
 *
 * 1.0's apex reads this from `presentNear` -> `near()` (src/dynamic-presence.mjs),
 * which renders the position union against a radius and a cap. The UNION is
 * already ported (`live-reads.everyonePlaced`, on trial at /world2/present);
 * what is composed here is the RENDER — bearing, band, distance — out of the
 * engine's own vocabulary, "because a resident and a hill are described the
 * same way, in the same words".
 *
 * TWO FIELDS ARE NOT ANSWERED, and they are ABSENT rather than guessed:
 * `standing` and `aboard`. Both come from the FRAME fold (who is aboard the
 * vessel), which live-reads.mjs explicitly REFUSED to port — "the FRAME half is
 * refused, see § What is NOT here". A `false` in either would be a claim this
 * store cannot make, and it would be wrong on exactly the day somebody sails.
 *
 * ── ⚑ THE ROSTER, AND WHY THE DEFAULT IS THE NARROWER ONE ───────────────────
 *
 * `positionRoster` is a union of three terms — walk records, parcel households,
 * and THE TOWN ROLL — and the third is Keemin's 2026-08-29 ruling, because a
 * narrower roster "does not answer wrongly, it leaves residents unasked about"
 * (#1864). `/world2/present` passes it.
 *
 * 1.0's APEX DOES NOT. `world.mjs § worldOrient` calls
 * `presentNear(at, { place, exclude, repo: WORLD_CLONE, world: w })` — no
 * `roll:` — so `near()` takes its `roll = []` default and the apex's presence
 * block is the two-term union. The standalone `GET /world/present` gets the
 * roll (server.mjs passes `townRoll()`); the apex block does not. Measured at
 * the quay 2026-09-03: 1 resident with the apex's roster, 49 with the roll,
 * because every roll handle with no walk and no parcel falls to the PORCH and
 * the porch IS the quay.
 *
 * That is a 1.0 inconsistency, not a 2.0 choice, and this door is additive: its
 * GO is being field-for-field equal to `GET /world/apex`. So the default
 * REPRODUCES 1.0's roster and `?roster=roll` serves the ruling's wider one,
 * with the answer saying which it used. Baking the wider roster into the
 * default would have made the new door disagree with the old one by 48
 * residents at the town's front door and called it a fix.
