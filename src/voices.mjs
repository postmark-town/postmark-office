// voices.mjs — earshot: speech in the world, and the record of it.
//
// A voice is { handle, text, at, x, y, place }: spoken where the resident
// stands, heard by whoever stands within EARSHOT_M of that point, and hearable
// there until the next settlement (POS-226, Keemin 2026-09-25: "settlements
// reset state, but between settlements all says remain indefinitely
// readable"). The town keeps its conversations the way it keeps its mail, so
// every voice also appends to a durable box-local JSONL log, and the
// conversations page reads back from that log.
//
// Two clocks, deliberately different:
//   the settlement — what an agent in the world can still HEAR (the ear's window)
//   the log        — what the town can still READ (the record)
//
// This module owns the rules (length, rate, earshot, window, clustering) so the
// door stays a door: mcp/REST call say/hear/conversations and dress the answer.
// It derives NO positions of its own — `standpoint` and `place` are injected by
// world.mjs, which owns the one position derivation the whole office shares.

// ── THE STANDING NUMBERS NOW STAND ON THE RECORD ─────────────────────────────
//
// Keemin, 2026-08-22: "let's update those dials for 'say'... make everything
// pull the actual numbers from there too. I think the predicates should be
// under the say edge rather than the residue, as we may rule future sounds
// differently." So every number below is read off `the-town/say`'s predicate
// children (the Keeping Works, postmark-edge/say/*), and the literals that
// follow are FALLBACK, NOT LAW — what a boot with no readable world store
// stands on, and nothing else.
//
// Read ONCE, at module init, deliberately. departurePace reads per call and is
// right to: one walk, one lookup. These are consulted inside the clustering
// loop and on every spoken line, so a per-call read would put SQLite in the
// speech path for numbers that move at a ruling. createVoices() is constructed
// once at boot and evaluates its defaults then, so an init-time read is no
// staler in practice than a per-construction one — and the office restarts on
// deploy, which is when a constitutional dial's change arrives anyway.
//
// THE DEPARTURE→DEPART LESSON, applied: a silent fallback is indistinguishable
// from a good read, and that is exactly how every walker in the world moved at
// a quarter of the lawful stride for five days. So the read is not silent —
// `SAY_DIALS` below records, per dial, whether the record answered, and
// `sayDialsDisclosure()` is the sentence a surface can print. A dial that fell
// back says so; it never passes its constant off as the town's word.

// SIBLING of its class and not a child of it, and the record spells the name
// `presence-min` where this module's key says `presence_min`. A falsifier that
// compared the published string to the same string typed again could not see
// any of it — so the id is no longer typed. `dialNode` walks the same
// `describes` edge `dialNumber` walks and returns what the record calls it
// (`the-town/presence-min`).
//
// Null when the store cannot answer. That is the same condition that makes
// `dialNumber` report `source: "fallback"`, so the two fields agree: we are

// this module must never grow a second answer to "where is this resident".

  // those coordinates are the water she was over at the time, and she leaves them
  // behind at ~20 m a minute: forty-one residents shared a deck for four hours of
  // crossing 117 and heard nothing, because the room kept sailing out from under
  // itself. The conversation was thirty kilometres astern.
  //
  // `clusterVoices` already applies the rule the record needs — two aboard voices
  // are one room however far the water moved — and this applies the same rule to
  // live hearing, with the relocation the pair-test alone cannot do: an aboard
  // voice is heard AT THE VESSEL'S POSITION NOW, so someone on the quay hears the
  // deck as she passes, not the open water she was over ten minutes ago.
  //
  // THE LOG IS UNTOUCHED. Occurrence is history and history has a place — the
  // stored x/y stay where the words were actually said. Only HEARING re-frames.
  //
  // INTERIM: Stage D (emissions ride their sources) makes this structural — a
  // voice attaches to its speaker, a speaker aboard attaches to the vessel, and a
  // shared deck becomes a room by construction rather than by this special case.
  // When that lands, this relocation is deleted, not ported.
  // Each kept voice carries `heardFrom` — the point it is heard FROM, which is
  // the vessel for a relocated one. The coarse distance in the reply must be
  // measured from there or the answer contradicts itself: a deck voice would be
  // reported as heard and then described as coming from beyond earshot.
  //
  // ── STAGE D: THAT LANDING, AND WHAT IT CHANGES ────────────────────────────
  //
  // With `heardFrom` injected (WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2 on) the relocation above is not
  // reached, and the aboard-flag special case is gone with it: the point a voice
  // is heard from is derived from the attachment its source rides, at the
  // instant it was spoken. THE PAIR TEST GOES TOO. `chains` treats two aboard
  // voices as one room because their coordinates lie; once both the voice and
  // the EAR have been moved to the thing they ride, they are at the same point
  // and plain distance is the whole rule — which is what "a room by
  // construction" means. `here.at` is already the vessel's position when the
  // hearer is riding, because the standpoint that produced it derived through
  // the same attachment (world-movement.mjs § movementStandpoint).
  //
  // The relocation is awaited per voice, so the snapshot below is async where
  // the ear's own test is not.
  //
  // ── THE ROOM, ONCE PER INSTANT (POS-265, the push) ────────────────────────
  //
  // Where a voice is heard FROM does not depend on who is listening: the
  // relocation above is a fact about the voice and the instant, and so is the
  // record's clustering. Only the last step — is that point within earshot of
  // THIS ear — belongs to the caller. So the work is split there. `snapshot(t)`
  // is the room computation: every audible voice with the point it is heard
  // from, and the record's clusters, derived once. `heardBy(here, snap)` is
  // the ear's arithmetic over it. A plain say or hear builds one snapshot per
  // call, as it always paid; the push (say-push.mjs) builds one per landed
  // voice and hands it to every waiter, which is what keeps fifty open waiters
  // at one room per voice rather than fifty.
