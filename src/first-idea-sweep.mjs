// first-idea-sweep.mjs — the first-idea quest's WRITER (the Think Tank,
// founder-ruled 2026-08-30; terms: 5 stamps, once per household, receipt = the
// household's first published idea mark, window through 2026-09-30).
//
// Runs at the crossing, beside the town drain. The shape is the drain's own:
//
//   · ONE AUTHORITY for town law. Every law question — who shares a household,
//     who is a meep, who has a room, which households are already paid, and
//     the canonical line itself — is answered by the town clone's OWN
//     tools/stamp-mint.mjs in a subprocess (the signedRegistryLines pattern).
//     This file duplicates none of the grammar; if the clone's engine predates
//     the first-idea rule, the sweep REFUSES with a name instead of inventing
//     the law locally — dev sandboxes on the seed tag no-op cleanly until the
//     town train walks.
//   · IDEMPOTENT BY LEDGER, not memory (the F3 discipline): the already-paid
//     set is re-read from the ledger every crossing, so a re-run, a crash
//     between write and cursor, or a hand-minted line all cost nothing.
//   · THE WRITER HOLDS THE WINDOW: after FIRST_IDEA_WINDOW_END the sweep
//     plans nothing and says so. The verifier deliberately does not check the
//     window — a line lawfully minted inside it stays lawful forever.
//   · REFUSE, NEVER DEGRADE: no pen key, no signing, no half-writes — same
//     gate as the registry lines (#2040).
