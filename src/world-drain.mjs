// world-drain.mjs — THE DRAIN. The journal empties into the record, once, as one act.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// POS-5 slice 2 of the world-runtime ladder (§3). Slice 1 made every world
// mutation one INSERT into an append-only journal in dynamic.db. This is the
// other end: at each settlement the journal empties upward into the world repo
// and then TRUNCATES, so the live layer only ever holds what has happened since
// the last save.
//
// §3, verbatim: "At each settlement: ratified marks → main (canon); still-
// unpublished drafts → written down to `draft/<household>` sketchbook branches
// (their ontological home: static-by-nature, not-yet-happened — a git branch
// that isn't main IS proto-canon); event lines → `STATE/log/<N>.jsonl`; then the
// journal TRUNCATES, sequence advances."
//
// The first clause — ratified marks to main — is the KEEPER'S chain and this
// module does not touch it. The settlement sweep goes on consuming the
// sketchbook branches exactly as it does today; what changes is who writes them.
//
// ── THE LAW THIS FILE ANSWERS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `the-atomic-drain` (world main, `logos/the-save/the-atomic-drain`, tier
// constitution, planted 2026-08-22):
//
//   "The drain's write-down and the journal's truncate are one act — a crash
//    between them eats no draft, and a lost save recomputes from the log."
//
// A working tree, a set of git refs and a SQLite file cannot join one
// transaction, so "one act" cannot be bought with a database primitive. It is
// bought with an ORDER and an INVARIANT:
//
//   THE TRUNCATE IS LAST, AND IT IS THE ONLY IRREVERSIBLE STEP.
//   Everything before it is idempotent and re-runnable.
//   Therefore the journal is always a SUPERSET of what has been written down,
//   never a subset — and a crash anywhere eats no draft, because the row that
//   was not yet written down is still in the journal to be written down again.
//
// The truncate itself IS atomic, because the delete and the cursor advance are
// one SQLite transaction. There is no state where the rows are gone and the
// cursor has not moved, or the reverse.
//
// Crash by crash, which is what `test/world-drain.test.mjs` injects:
//
//   before the write-down     nothing happened; a re-run drains everything.
//   mid write-down            some sketchbook refs moved, others did not. The
//                             cursor has not moved, so a re-run replays ALL
//                             rows; the households already written get the same
//                             tree, which produces no second commit at all.
//   after write-down          the record holds it, the journal still holds it.
//   before the truncate       A re-run is a no-op write-down plus the truncate.
//   during the truncate       SQLite's transaction decides: both, or neither.
//   after the truncate        the cursor says so; a re-run drains nothing.
//
// "A lost save recomputes from the log" is the second clause, and it is why
// every run is pinned to an INSTANT (`at`). Commit dates come from that instant,
// never from the wall clock, so replaying an interrupted drain at the same
// instant lands the same tree under the same commit sha. Byte-identical
// convergence is a claim about shas here, not a hopeful phrase.
//
// ── NO CHECKOUT, EVER ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The write-down is pure git plumbing against a private index: hash-object,
// read-tree, update-index, write-tree, commit-tree, update-ref. The clone's
// working tree is never touched and never consulted, which matters for three
// reasons. The tree belongs to whatever else is using it (the settlement, a
// crossing-save, a flag-off write pen). A checkout is exactly the machinery §2
// retires. And `update-ref` with an expected old value is a compare-and-swap, so
// a branch someone else moved underneath us is refused rather than clobbered.
//
// ── TWO DESTINATIONS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF THING ───────────────────
//
// §0: "the dynamic DB is the runtime journal; STATE/ is its crystallized
// history; the sketchbook is proto-canon; main is canon."
//
// So EVERY row goes to STATE — including mark rows. The sketchbook holds a
// mark's FINAL state, which is all canon needs; the amend chain, the withdrawal,
// and every line's pinned witnesses are HISTORY, and if the drain dropped them
// the constitutional record `the-witnessed-line` establishes would evaporate
// every twelve hours. Mark rows go to the sketchbook IN ADDITION, not instead.
//
// ── WHY A SEPARATE LOG FILE FROM crossing-save's ─────────────────────────────
//
// `tools/crossing-save.mjs` also writes `STATE/log/<N>.*`, and it is DERIVATIVE:
// it rebuilds each window from the store every run and its whole determinism
// story is "same store, same instant, same bytes". The journal's rows are
// CONSUMED — after the truncate they exist nowhere else — so crossing-save could
// never re-derive them, and the first time it rewrote a window it would erase
// them.
//
// Two writers with two recovery stories are not one file. The drain writes
// `STATE/log/<N>.journal.jsonl` (+ `.journal.meta.json`) in the same line
// grammar, and unifying the two into one window file is named work, not
// something to sneak in under a slice that must not lose records. See the
// handback's remainder.
//
// Env: WORLD_SINGLE_LOG=1 (the drain refuses without it — the flag family is
// one switch), WORLD_CLONE, WORLD_DYNAMIC_DB, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL.

/**
 * THE PUBLIC LEDGERS, materialized from the journal at the save.
 *
 * Ruled 2026-08-22: "walks + enter-exit should settle at the save, not per-act
 * to git main." Every walk and every crossing used to spend one commit on main.
 * Behind WORLD_SINGLE_LOG the acts write a journal row instead, and this is
 * where the record receives them — once, with everything else the save writes.
 *
 * APPENDS THE LINES VERBATIM. The rows carry the exact text the acting pen
 * formatted (`payload.lines`), so this does not re-derive a single character.
 * That is what makes "the record carries the same lines the per-act commits
 * would have" true by construction rather than by two formatters agreeing —
 * the lesson slice 2 paid for when one serialization had two homes.
 *
 * IN SEQ ORDER, ACROSS LEDGERS. The journal's own order is the order the acts
 * happened in, and both ledgers are append-only records of a sequence; sorting
 * by anything else would put a resident's exit before the entry it answers.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT, like everything else the drain does before the truncate: a line
 * already present in the ledger is not appended twice, so a crash between the
 * write-down and the truncate replays to the same file.
 *
 * ── THE ENTER/EXIT RECORD IS NOT ONE OF THESE, AND MUST NOT BE (#2152) ──────
 *
 * The passage record stopped being a file anybody appends to on 2026-08-26. It
 * is DERIVED at read time office-side — the frozen era from the clone plus the
 * journal's rows — and the world repo's own law, `tools/enter-exit-record.test.
 * mjs`, says what its committed copy must be, quoted verbatim:
 *
 *     "the world repo has no journal to read — a longer derived file means a
 *      hand wrote in it"
 *
 * So the committed copy is the frozen era EXACTLY, 155 act-lines, forever. Two
 * office pens went on appending live passages into it anyway — this loop and
 * the crossing-save's emit — and each append turned the world's grammar suite
 * red, which cost the settlement sweep its ability to attribute a failure to a
 * candidate and refused the whole crossing. Three hand-repairs (world main
 * 06c741d5, fd801ebe, and the instance before them) before the writers were
 * found.
 *
 * The filter is EXPLICIT rather than incidental. A production clone happens not
 * to be missing these files, so the "no such ledger in this clone" branch below
 * would not have caught this; and a filter that works only because a file is
 * absent is a filter that comes back the day somebody adds the file.
 *
 * WALK LEDGER LINES STILL ROUTE. `WORLD/walk-ledger.md` is a committed
 * append-only record with no deriver — this is its only pen, and it is lawful.
 * That is the whole reason this loop survives at all.
 *
 * (World 2.0's database migration supersedes this seam; until it lands, the
 * passage record has exactly one writer and it is the reader.)

/**
 * ── THE FRAME BUG, AND WHY THIS FUNCTION GREW A SECOND WAY IN (2026-08-27) ────
 *
 * On 2026-08-27T01:13:12.971Z an amend of `vermillion/the-pando-peak` was
 * drained, and the record that landed said:
 *
 *   at: { x: -95458, y: -95458 }        (was: at: { x: 0, y: 0 })
 *
 * at `WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/pando-peak/the-pando-peak/mark.md` — a
 * FOSSIL path, nested under the `pando-peak` region, whose composed centre IS
 * (-95458, -95458). So the file's own frame added the offset a second time and
 * the mountain composed to roughly (-190916, -190916), ~95km outside the world.
 * Eleven vessel/timetable tests went red at 03:22:57Z — the landing stands on
 * that peak — and the crossing published nothing for anybody until a human
 * reverted it by hand at 03:50Z.
 *
 * THE RESIDENT MOVED NOTHING. They restated their mountain's true WORLD
 * position, which is what the journal stores by design ("a declaration is stored
 * in world coordinates as the resident spoke them"). The machinery moved it.
 *
 * The mechanism, exactly: `planDrain` DID decide the row was nested — Gate A
 * hands an amend its frozen fossil filing, which is three segments deep — and
 * DID call this framer. But the framer could only answer from `parent_id`, and a
 * SITED mark carries no `parent_id` in the door's grammar; only predicated and
 * naming marks do. So `origin` came back null, the conversion returned `{}`, and
 * the world coordinate went into a relative-framed file raw.
 *
 * Which is why the sited/parcel arm was believed unreachable. The drain's own
 * comment said "this is currently identity for every row shape the door can
 * produce", and `world-drain.test.mjs` has a test whose name asserts the frame
 * conversion "has no live caller at this door". Both were reasoning about a
 * CREATE, where Gate B files at the id and the path really is root-level. Nobody
 * re-checked them against an AMEND, where Gate A hands back a fossil. The
 * premise was true when written, the freeze made it false on 2026-08-25, and the
 * comment went on being read as current.
 *
 * THE FIX: the origin is resolved from the PATH THE RECORD IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN
 * TO, and `parent_id` becomes the fallback rather than the only way in. The path
 * is the honest source — it is what the fold will compose against — and it is
 * available for free, because `filing-freeze.json` is a map of id → directory
 * and inverting it gives directory → id.
 *
 * Null still means DO NOT CONVERT, and still for the same reason: an unconverted
 * root-level record is exactly right, and a converted-by-guesswork nested one is
 * a mark in the wrong place forever.
