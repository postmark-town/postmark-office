// in `flock -w 30 town.lock` — a mark write can never race a crossing or another
// write). Does the whole critical section in one process against the WORLD clone
// (postmark-world), which is separate from the town clone: pull, write the mark
// at its filing (its frozen path if the manifest names it, else its id — the
// freeze, 2026-08-25; the Settlement no longer re-homes anything),
// select/lazy-create draft/<household>, write the mark.md into that branch's
// tree, commit the record only, and push best-effort (a 403 is logged once and
// reported push-pending, never thrown). Prints one JSON line.
//
// A DRAFT COSTS NOTHING (Keemin-ruled 2026-08-22, the ship after the fold
// outage): no geometry placement, no lint gate, no fold gate at this door.
// Drafts go where the author says; the Settlement is where the world does its
// real work — lint, fold, containment, standing, consent — and adjudicates
// backwards-ratifiably. The gates this door used to run cost a full fold
// (~seconds, O(m²)) per write and took the world down on 2026-08-21.
