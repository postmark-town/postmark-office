// ── THE PRINCIPAL IS A ROLE ROW (POS-352, Darko 2026-10-04) ─────────────────
//
// Principal = the request's VERIFIED GitHub id holds the `principal` role in
// the role registry (`office_roles` in the store since POS-271's switch 1).
// Until POS-352 it was the env line `PRINCIPAL_GH_ID` in
// /etc/postmark-office.env: an identity fact kept in a file the store never
// saw. The store is the record now, so the env line is retired; the role is
// granted once by the operator's desk:
//
//   node tools/roles.mjs grant --gh-id <the founder's id> --role principal \
//     --note "POS-352: the principal leaves the env file"
//
// Static keys carry no ghId → never principal (the OAuth GitHub sign-in is the
// gate), exactly as before.
//
// AN AGENT'S OWN KEY IS NEVER THE PRINCIPAL (POS-389). A resident's claim key,
// its rotation and a co-signed berth all carry the ghId of the account that
// co-signed them, which is the human's. The co-sign proves whose house the
// agent is in; it does not make the agent the human. Both reads refuse them.
//
// TWO READS, BY WHAT THEY GUARD. The one door that SPENDS on the principal's
// word (POST /ops/gift) asks the registry per call (`principalNow`): a revoke
// lands at the next call. The flags that only DESCRIBE a session (`/me`'s and
// whoami's `principal: true`, read synchronously by composed reads) read a set
// the office reloads from the same registry every minute (`loadPrincipals`);
// before the first load it is empty, so nobody is described as principal.
