// fund-holder.mjs — WHOSE NAME A PAYMENT GOES IN: the signed-in account's household,
// and the one resident who holds its stamps (POS-317, Keemin 2026-10-02).
//
// Keemin's 09-21 direction (docs/2026-09-21/design-notes/pos-157-fund-attribution-
// addendum.md) and his rulings of 2026-10-02: a payment credits the HOUSEHOLD, not
// a resident; a signed-in payer sees their household's name and types nothing; a
// signed-out payer is an outside gift.
//
// ── THE REFERENCE IS THE ACCOUNT, NEVER A SLUG ──────────────────────────────
//
// The page mints the signed-in account's GitHub id into each rail's own
// reference: Stripe `<pot>_g<id>`, PayPal `<pot>|g<id>`, the USDC form's
// `household: g<id>`. Not the household slug: four slugs carry a dot (Stripe's
// reference takes only letters, digits, `-` and `_`) and one is 858 characters
// (Stripe allows 200, PayPal 127). An account id is short, stable, and is the
// key the registry already binds households by (households.json § accounts).
//
// ── `from:` STAYS A RESIDENT HANDLE ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Measured before building (docs/2026-10-02/rail/fund-household/measure-from.out):
// the town's close reads a pot-receipt's `from:` as a HANDLE. `isResident(from)`
// asks the white pages, `hhKey(from)` finds the household for the ρ cap and the
// self-stake exclusion, and the holo row puts the stamps on that account. A slug
// there would mint nothing, or pay a resident whose handle happens to equal it.
// So the household is resolved to ONE resident, and `from:` names that handle.
// The credit is still the household's: the close caps and excludes by household.
//
// ── WHICH RESIDENT: ONE FUNCTION, ONE RULE (open with Keemin) ───────────────
//
// For a household with several residents, `holderOf` picks the holder. The
// default is the join bundle's own FIRST RESIDENT rule, the town's
// (tools/stamp-mint.mjs --welcome-plan): the earliest `pinned` date in
// tools/github-ids.json among the house's residents, ties alphabetical, a
// resident with no pin after every pinned one; meeps are skipped (they stay
// outside the currency). Keemin may instead rule that the household chooses
// (one dropdown); `choose` is the seam for that, and every caller (the Stripe
// and PayPal watchers, the /fund door, GET /me for the page) asks this one
// function, so the page always shows the name the watcher will credit.

// and tools/github-ids.json, which the drain renders FROM the store's households
// and household_pins (registry-drain, byte-equal by --check). So an account bound
// in the store and not yet printed was a gift, and a printout edited by hand was
// a payer the store had never heard of. Now every payer, on every rail, is
// resolved from the store's own rows, and the resident set a typed handle is
// checked against is the store's roll (town_residents), not the clone's rooms.
//
// A store that can't be read is a THROW, never an empty registry. An empty one
// would turn every payer into an outside gift, which is a guess about whose money
// it was. Every caller refuses its tick or its request on the throw, and the
// payment is decided again next time, exactly as an unreadable printout held it.
