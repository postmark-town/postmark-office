// walkers-read-the-store.test.mjs — `storedDepartures` reads the RECORD, and the
// four doors that stand on it keep answering what they answered (POS-154, the
// walker half of Everything Reads the Store).
//
// ── WHAT IS ON TRIAL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world-movement.mjs § storedDepartures` opened `dynamic.db` and folded the
// `movements` table. It reads `acts` under `DEPARTURE_ACTIONS` now, through the
// read worker's one road, and the sqlite open is GONE rather than kept under a
// flag — one question, one owner. Everything downstream is unchanged in what it
// reads: `GET /world/orient`, `/world/present`, `/world/walkers`, the say door's
// earshot, and `framesByHandle`'s frame overlay.
//
// ── WHY A FIXTURE STORE AND NOT A REAL ONE ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `useGuardReader` installs a stand-in for `officeRead` — the seam
// `test/world2-guard-doors.test.mjs` already uses, and the reason is the same:
// the port's own equality falsifier needs Postgres, a world checkout and a
// scratch database, so it can only ever run on the box; the BEHAVIOUR of the
// reader has to be provable anywhere or it is proven once and never again.
//
// ⚑ THE SEAM REPLACES THE ROAD, SO IT CANNOT SEE THE ROAD. A test driving
// `useGuardReader` proves what the reader does with rows; it cannot prove the
// rows arrived inside `officeRead`'s `BEGIN READ ONLY` on one pooled connection,
// because that is exactly the thing it stood in for. That claim is pinned as
// SOURCE TEXT below instead of asserted behaviourally, and the distinction is
// deliberate (POS-162's finding, verbatim: a test seam that replaces a road
// cannot see what the road does).
//
// ── THE PLANTED WALK ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every equality here would pass with the reader doing nothing if the fixture
// merely agreed with a tree. So the fixture store carries a walk — `ghost-walker`
// — that stands in NO ledger, NO clone and NO sqlite: its only existence is the
// rows. If the answer cannot see it, the reader is not reading the store.
//
// ── THE FLIP (run before the commit; the red line is in the PR body) ─────────
//
// In `src/world-movement.mjs § storedDepartures`, restore the sqlite read:
// replace the `storeDepartureRows()` call with the old
// `openDynamic(path, { readOnly: true })` + `readMovements(h, { until: atMs })`
// fold. Every case below that names the store goes red, and the one that names
// the CAUSE rather than a symptom is THE PLANTED WALK: a walk that exists only
// in the record is not returned, because the reader went back to a file.
//
// Run: node --test test/walkers-read-the-store.test.mjs
