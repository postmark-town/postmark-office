// `world-apex.mjs § actsOfActor` is the ONE input of `rideStateFrom`, and it
// used to open the sqlite journal. The journal is truncated at the drain, so an
// `enter` older than the drain cursor was simply not there — and a rider whose
// entry had been drained away was set down NOWHERE on exit, because the deposit
// rule (rightly) refuses to move somebody who cannot prove where they came from.
//
// `acts` is never truncated. These tests are about that difference, and each one
// is built so it can express the failure rather than merely fail to regress:
//
//   F1  the pure fold, both populations — the STORE's rows (entry present) set
//       the rider down at the stop they came in through; the JOURNAL's rows for
//       the same rider, post-drain, set them down nowhere. F1 is what makes the
//       defect a sentence. It passes on main too, and says so: it is the
//       statement of the problem, not the proof of the fix.
//   F2  `crossingDeps().acts` asks the STORE — one query, the acts table, the
//       ruled replay order, and the three columns the fold consumes. REDS ON
//       MAIN, where the function opens sqlite and never reaches a pool at all.
//   F3  a drained rider, end to end through the deps the office hands the
//       crossing: the entry is in the store and NOT in sqlite, and the fold
//       still names the stop. REDS ON MAIN.
//   F4  the store's own shapes, which main never had to survive: `payload` is
//       `jsonb`, so the driver hands back a PARSED OBJECT. Main's reader calls
//       `JSON.parse` on its column; handed an object it answers `{}` for every
//       row and every ride vanishes. REDS ON MAIN.
//   F5  the fail-safe, kept exactly: a store that cannot be opened answers with
//       no history, and the deposit rule then declines to move the rider.
//   F6  ORDER BY `journal_seq` would be the tempting spelling and it is wrong —
//       under the pen flip that column is NULL for the whole flipped era.
//       Measured on prod 2026-09-21: 486 of 606 `frame` rows carry none.
//   F7  the sqlite read is GONE, not layered under a fallback (the brief's "one
//       question, one owner"). A source pin, and labelled as the weaker kind:
//       F2/F3 are what prove the chain.
//
// ⚑ THE CONTROL EVERY IDENTITY CLAIM HERE CARRIES: an assertion that two
// derived lists match says the same sentence when both are empty. Where this
// file compares populations it asserts non-emptiness in the same breath.
