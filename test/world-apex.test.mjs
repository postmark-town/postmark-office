// world-apex.test.mjs — Stage 3's apex verb: the gate, the dispatch, the terms,
// and the mail asymmetry.
//
// Seven falsifiers, each written so it CAN fail:
//
//   the flag off   the `world` tool is absent from tools/list, the verb itself
//                  refuses, and GET /world/apex is not a door. Asserted against
//                  the SAME list the door serves, not a copy of it.
//   the gate       a hostile mark authored by a RESIDENT, standing on the
//                  caller's own spine, carrying a perfectly well-formed
//                  `affordances:` field, mints nothing — nor does one that
//                  claims constitution tier, nor a market-tier mark of the
//                  town's own. Ambient widens reach, never trust.
//   dispatch       an action afforded where you stand reaches the existing
//                  implementation; one that is not afforded bounces AND names
//                  the coordinates where it is.
//   the terms      the law that binds the act arrives with the act; resident
//                  prose can only ever arrive under `quoted`, authored; and the
//                  whole payload obeys the hard cap even when someone has piled
//                  four thousand characters onto the ground you stand on.
//   the mail       `do: send-letter` bounces, and the bounce says letters reach
//                  anyway. This one is a promise, not a limitation.
//   ambient        a class declaring world-wide reach is affordable 40 km from
//                  the mark that grants it — and a RESIDENT mark declaring the
//                  same reaches nobody. Reach and trust are separate rules.
//   anonymous      GET /world/apex?x=&y= answers keyless, with affordances.
//
// A miniature world clone and a hand-built world.db, both thrown away after —
// the same discipline world-serve.test.mjs uses, and for the same reason: what
// is under test is the apex layer's behaviour over a store, not hydration.

// ── ISOLATION: A PRIVATE TEMP FOR THIS RUN ───────────────────────────────────
//
// The office caches the world ENGINE in a machine-global directory keyed by the
// world clone's commit sha — `os.tmpdir()/postmark-engine/<sha>--tools`
// (world-branches.mjs), and the hydrator's materialiser uses the sibling
// `postmark-world-store/<sha>`. Both are shared by every postmark process on the
// box, and the fixture below collides on that key with a certainty rather than a
// probability: its tree is fixed text and its commit carries no nonce, so two
// processes that build it in the same second produce THE SAME SHA. Four parallel
// runs of this file, four temp repos, one commit id — measured, not assumed.
//
// So concurrent runs write each other's engine modules while importing out of
// the same directory. That is a hazard closed on the geometry of the thing, not
// a failure caught in the act: the collision is measured, the torn import is
// not — the failures actually reproduced here came from the port below. It is
// closed anyway because a shared mutable cache under a colliding key is not a
// thing to leave standing behind a suite whose whole job is to be falsifiable.
//
// Redirecting TEMP gives this process its own cache root, and it must happen
// BEFORE the first `../src` import, because those constants are computed at
// module load. `os.tmpdir()` reads the environment on every call, on Windows and
// POSIX alike, so this is the whole fix.

// represented, and `resolveGrants` filtering by kind had nothing to admit and
// nothing even to refuse.
