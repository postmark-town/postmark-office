// Falsifiers for the LAW PEN'S OWN CLOCK — postmark#2893, founder-ruled
// 2026-09-19 ("split for now is good").
//
// ── WHAT IS BEING HELD, AND WHY IT IS WORTH A SUITE ─────────────────────────
// `deploy/world2-ingest.sh` carries both projection pens: `law-ingest` (the
// rulebook → law_projection + identities) and `stamp-ingest` (the ledger →
// stamp_projection). Its unit, postmark-world2-ingest.timer, is PARKED at the
// founder's word of 2026-08-31 — and the law pen is the only writer of
// law_projection anywhere in the office, so the park froze the rulebook copy:
// a23a8d17 (09-05) → one hand-run to 1688a5af (09-17) → 37 commits behind world
// main by 09-19. The split gives the law pen its own unit, and the split IS the
// mode argument. One copy of each pen; one script; a word on the command line.
//
// That makes the dispatch the load-bearing line in the change. If `law` ever
// runs the stamp pen too, this lane silently re-adopts the rail the founder
// parked — and it would do so while every surface still said PARKED, which is
// the exact failure shape #2893 is about.
//
// ── THREE ARMS, INCREASING IN STRENGTH ──────────────────────────────────────
//   1. STATIC   — parse the shipped `case` block; assert each arm's flags and
//                 that the unknown-mode arm refuses. Needs nothing but the file.
//   2. UNIT     — read the shipped .service/.timer: ExecStart names the mode,
//                 the timer keeps the parked poll's marks, and the parked
//                 unit's own files are NOT rewritten to carry a mode.
//   3. EXECUTED — run the WHOLE shipped script under bash against a stubbed
//                 tree: a stub `node` on PATH that logs its argv, a stub
//                 refresh-clone that prints a 40-char sha, and the PG password
//                 handed in through the environment (w2_secret reads the env
//                 first, so no credential file is opened). This is the only arm
//                 that proves which PEN FILE was invoked rather than which
//                 variable was set.
//
// bash is not a dependency the rest of this suite has, so arm 3 SKIPS with its
// reason printed when bash is absent — never silently, and never by weakening
// arms 1 and 2.
//
// THE FLIP, run before this file was committed: collapse the dispatch so every
// mode sets RUN_LAW=1 and RUN_STAMPS=1 (the pre-split behaviour). Arms 1 and 3
// go red; arm 2 stays green, which is correct and is why arm 3 exists.
