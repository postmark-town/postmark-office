// votes-read-worker.test.mjs — the ballot box is a READ, and a read worker
// answers it (postmark-town/postmark#3383).
//
// Since POS-266 every GET on prod is answered by a read worker, which boots as
// `--role read` and is never `canWrite` (server.mjs § canWrite). GET /votes and
// the doorstep's votes garnish both asked for `canWrite`, so on prod the Ballot
// Box answered `409 not-yet-open` to the whole town and every doorstep dropped
// its votes block, while the worker's own town clone held the engine. Nothing
// went red because no test asked a worker for either.
//
// These legs boot a REAL read worker the way the pool boots one (`--role read`,
// the writer's town clone in TOWN_CLONE) and ask over HTTP:
//
//   § 1  GET /votes and GET /votes/{topic} answer 200 with the town's closed
//        ballot, read from the real town clone through its own engine
//   § 2  a /doorstep served by a worker carries the votes block for an open
//        topic (a small clone of the engine with one staking ballot)
//   § 3  the stake is still a write: a read worker refuses POST /votes/stake
//
// THE FLIP: put `!canWrite ||` back on the GET /votes gate and § 1 reds with
// 409; put `canWrite &&` back on the doorstep garnish and § 2 reds.
