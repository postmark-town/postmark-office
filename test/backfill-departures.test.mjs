// backfill-departures.test.mjs — the four-day hole's filler, over a fixture

//
//   world.mjs § walkEntry            the ONE row shape for a walk act,
//                                    "whichever pen records it" — `within` and
//                                    `to`, the movement store's own column
//                                    names, and no sixth spelling.
//   live-reads.mjs § era 5           `p.from && p.toward && !p.lines &&
//                                    !p._ledger` — the movement-store era, which
//                                    a `_backfill` key must not disturb.
//   live-reads.mjs § DEPARTURE_ORDER_SQL / governingDepartures
//                                    "the governing departure per handle" is the
//                                    LAST row in append order — so an appended
//                                    row outranks every act already filed.
//   001_tables.sql § acts            `id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY` —
//                                    there is no id to slot a backfill into.
//   017_source_underscore.sql        the underscore is the town's word for a key
//                                    the store owns.
//
// NO POSTGRES AND NO SNAPSHOT. Every case drives the tool's pure half against a
// sqlite store this file builds and an array of acts it writes out, so the suite
// runs in any pool tree on any machine. The run against the real 2026-09-21
// snapshot is the lane's own falsifier and its receipt is in the day doc.
