// await-clearing.test.mjs — THE ORDER INVERTS AT THE SWAP (G1 lane 3).
//
//   node --test test/await-clearing.test.mjs
//
// In the git era the settlement and the candle were independent: the sweep
// committed at :45:32 and the clearing locked window 177's docket at :45:44, so
// the fold ran BEFORE the clearing and did not care. After G1 the fold's input
// IS the clearing's output, so the crossing has to wait.
//
// The whole decision is in one pure function, and it is pure for a reason that
// matters more than usual here: the impure half is a sleep loop, and a sleep
// loop is the one thing a test cannot exercise honestly. So the loop does
// nothing but call this and sleep, and this is what is falsified.
//
// THE TWO WRONG CONDITIONS ARE TESTED AS WELL AS THE RIGHT ONE, because both are
// more obvious than the right one and either would ship silently:
//   "the most recently closed window" — returns the PREVIOUS crossing's docket
//     when the clearing has not run, so the wait waits for nothing.
//   "the currently open window has closed" — waits twelve hours when the
//     clearing already ran before the tool was reached.

// ── AND THE OPERATOR DOOR (postmark#2786, ruled 2026-09-14) ──────────────────
//
// The four falsifiers at the foot of this file watch `--by-hand`, the second
// door: the newest CLOSED window that is still UNFOLDED, for the operator whose
// previous crossing published nothing. The first of them is the one that matters
// most and it watches the OLD path — the timer's refusal, byte for byte —
// because a second door is only safe while the first is untouched.
