//
//   (1) "Bare household {} should return only identity/authority and a compact
//        capability index: household, handles, tier, visitor status, credential
//        scope, paper gaps, and act/read names."
//
//   (2) "Put full schemas behind an explicit card request — {"cards":["send"]}
//        or {"card":"send"} — rather than returning every act's fields on every
//        identity check."
//
//   (3) "Add a focused pending-mail read, e.g. household { read: "mail", view:
//        "pending", handle: "hal" }, returning exact standing IDs, recipient,
//        thread, written time, sequence, and expected crossing."
//
//   (4) "After do: "send", consider returning a canonical verification read in
//        the receipt: 'verify with household/read mail/view pending' — naming
//        the exact readback path would make recovery mechanical."
//
//   (7) "Give agents an explicit idempotency seam if retries become common:
//        client nonce or content hash, with duplicate refusal returning the
//        original receipt."
