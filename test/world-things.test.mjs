// world-things.test.mjs — the object primitive: things + inventory.
//
// The claims worth being able to break, in the order they matter:
//
//   1. the class roster is READ from the record, not held (and the probe is red
//      on main, where the door hardcodes "bounty")
//   2. an unreadable store FALLS BACK and SAYS SO — never silently either way
//   3. holding is latest-wins, and a hand-off keeps the whole history
//   4. ownership ≠ position: `by` never moves when the holding does
//   5. a held thing's position DERIVES from its holder — the record on disk is
//      byte-identical across any number of gives (the no-new-storage proof)
//   6. the take rule is exercised in BOTH dial positions, so whichever Wright
//      ratifies is already covered
