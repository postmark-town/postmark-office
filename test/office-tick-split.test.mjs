// office-tick-split.test.mjs — the office tick, split in two (POS-268, 2026-09-27).
//
// The rehydrate unit used to run everything the office does on a clock: pull
// the clones, catch the mint up, write the settlements row, publish the panes,
// AND rebuild office.db + world.db. Retiring the sqlite reads deletes the last
// of those and must not delete the rest, so the keeping work moved to its own
// unit and the rehydrate unit keeps only the two hydrates.
//
// ⚑ TEXT PINS, like welcome-pass.test.mjs and settlements-backfill.test.mjs:
// nothing in a unit test can run a systemd unit, and what these hold is which
// file carries which line.
