//
// WHAT IS BEING FALSIFIED. `WORLD/households.json`'s `logins` map is what the
// Settlement sweep's authorship wall and the PR lane's lane-wall resolve a
// sketchbook's NAME through. Until 2026-09-09 it bound exactly two things — a
// pin's GitHub login, and a `login:`-keyed household's own name — so a household
// of any other shape was invisible to the wall.
//
// AND INVISIBLE IS THE DANGEROUS WORD. The sweep's own rule is that a branch it
// cannot bind is LEFT ALONE rather than refused: "unverifiable is the status
// quo, never a new refusal (registry lag must not strand the pen's own writes)"
// (`settlement-sweep.mjs:905-919`). So an unbindable household is not a refusal
// anybody sees. It is every mark in that household publishing with its
// authorship unchecked while every test stays green. That is the same silence
// `store-writedown.mjs` exists to keep a RENAME from causing, arriving from the
// registry's own side instead.
//
// Measured against the live town, 2026-09-09: 108 distinct household keys, of
// which SEVEN — every `hh:<house>` key the town has minted — were bound by
// nothing. Three of them own standing marks.
//
// THE TESTS THAT MATTER MOST ARE H4 AND H5, and neither has a live instance
// today. Both are the ways this projection could bind a sketchbook to the WRONG
// household, which is strictly worse than leaving it unbound: an unbound branch
// makes the wall stand down, a mis-bound one makes it wall the wrong marks. Zero
// occurrences is exactly when a guard is cheap to write and impossible to test
// later.
//
// The write-down side of the same change is F10 in test/store-writedown.test.mjs,
// where F6b and F6e stand as its unchanged control.
