// ── `measured` — the door's own answer to "can this row be counted?" ─────────
//
// BOARD_LAW puts two kinds of row on one board and tells them apart by a TYPE,
// not a field: a countable row's `progress` is a number, an uncounted row's is
// null. So every consumer wrote `typeof q.progress === "number"` for itself, and
// the site's own note says why it had to key on the field rather than an id list
// ("the allow-list again wearing a different name"). A predicate two doors each
// re-derive is a predicate two doors can come to disagree about. The door states
// it now, and these pin what it states.
//
// The registry here carries a THIRD row NO FOLD ON THIS BOARD CAN COUNT, which
// is the whole point: `COUNTABLE_FIELD` names `send` and `receive` and nothing
// else, and `walk-the-world` is settled from the world rather than from either
// fold on this board — so with the world unreadable (see BLIND_WORLD below) it
// attaches a note naming the surface that can answer, and nothing else. That is
// the town's own mechanism, not a shape invented for the test.
//
// ⚑ THAT SENTENCE USED TO READ "the standing join has no fact for it", and it
// stopped being true on 2026-09-14 (#2773): the join settles this row from the
// home's world block now, because a page that filed "not looked" under "still
// to do" was telling placed residents to go and get placed. What makes the row
// an exemplar here is the UNREADABLE world the fixture hands it, not an absence
// in the office — and the fixture says so rather than relying on the box.
//
// ⚑ WHY NOT `first-idea`, which stood here until the w37 continuation ship
// (2026-09-08). Since the standing join, that row is settled from the WORLD
// record whenever `world.db` sits beside the office (`DEFAULT_DB`): with the
// store answering it reads `progress: 0`, measured — so a test that used it as
// the uncounted exemplar went green in a bare worktree and red in the primary
// clone, by nothing but whether a stray `world.db` lay at the repo root. A test
// whose oracle is a file lying about is not a test of the door. The row the
// board genuinely cannot count is the exemplar; `first-idea`'s own measure under
// a real store is pinned in quest-standing.test.mjs, where the store is a
// fixture, not an accident of the checkout.

// ── THE FIXTURE OWNS ITS WORLD (#2773) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// `walk-the-world` is this file's exemplar of an UNCOUNTED row, and it earned
// that role because no fold on the board could settle it. One now can: the
// board reads the home's world block and answers `complete` from `sited`. So
// the row is uncounted only where the world cannot be read — and whether the
// world can be read is a fact about the BOX this suite runs on, not about the
// office. Left alone these legs would pass on a machine with no world clone and
// red on one that has it, for a reason that has nothing to do with `measured`.
//
// So the fixture hands the board a world it cannot see, and the exemplar is an
// exemplar again on every box. What these legs are about is unchanged: a row no
// fold can count must SAY so.
//
// ⚑ AND WHAT THE TOWN'S TABLE IS AN ORACLE FOR, now that there are two folds.
// `COUNTABLE_FIELD` is the DAILY fold's table; `measured` is the union of that
// fold and the standing join. The two agree here because this fixture's third
// row is unreadable, and that is a precondition rather than a coincidence — a
// board whose world answered would carry a measured row the town's table does
// not name, correctly.
