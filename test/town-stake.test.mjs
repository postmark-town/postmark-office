// THE LAW every falsifier here quotes, VERBATIM from the world record rather
// than paraphrased — postmark-world, WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/
// the-town-centre/the-keeping-works/postmark-edge/stake/mark.md, the class mark
// `the-town/stake` (v2, `subject: resident`, `object: mark`):
//
//   "A stake is ✦ held in escrow behind a mark — belief with weight, standing
//    until taken back, and the record keeps both the placing and the
//    withdrawal."
//
// and its child `the-town/stake-mark` (v1, `from-class: resident`,
// `to-class: mark`), .../postmark-edge/stake/stake-mark/mark.md:
//
//   "A mark stake is presence with weight — it raises the ✦ at the fold,
//    anchors the mark against retiring, and returns whole at the unstake."
//
// ── WHY NO NEW CONSTITUTIONAL ROW WAS PLANTED ───────────────────────────────
//
// The TDD-board method says: if the act needs a law row, plant it first and
// build to green. This act needs none, and the reason is readable in the two
// frontmatters above. The class types the act by its SUBJECT and its OBJECT — a
// resident, a mark — and says nothing whatever about which door the resident
// reaches through, because a door is office machinery and the record is the
// town's constitution. `world do: "stake"` already carries `blurb_from:
// "the-town/stake"` and `from: "the-town/resident"`; a town-door stake that
// dispatches to the same act is the SAME act granted by the same class, reached
// from a second doorway. Planting a `the-town/town-stake` row would have been
// writing the office's furniture into the constitution — the precise inversion
// classes.md forbids ("a door implementation is correct precisely insofar as it
// READS the class tree, and wrong wherever it hardcodes").
//
// What the record DID have to say was already said and already recorded: the
// 2026-08-30 ruling that the town door carries the stake gesture, target-typed.
// That was law when this build started; this build is its implementation.
