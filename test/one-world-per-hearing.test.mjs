// one-world-per-hearing.test.mjs — ONE ROOM, ONE WORLD (Wright's shape A, 2026-10-01).
//
// A hearing snapshot (voices.mjs § snapshot, one per say) asks the structural
// hook where every audible voice is heard from. The hook used to resolve the
// world for EVERY voice — world() → publishedState → blessed() → refStamp, six
// statSyncs each — and under the endurance run's 80 agents that was 52.6% of the
// office's thread (docs/2026-10-02/rail/endurance-294/RECEIPT.md § Where the
// thread went). Now the snapshot hands every voice the same `room`, and the hook
// resolves the world once per room. The memo's freshness is untouched: a new
// snapshot is a new room, so a ref that moves is seen by the next say.
//
// The laws on trial:
//   1. every voice in one snapshot is heard through ONE room; the next snapshot
//      gets another (no stub world needed);
//   2. over N voices, the real hook asks world() once per say, not N times;
//   3. what a say hears is identical with the room and without it, on the real
//      world: two stores, the same voices and clock, one hook keeping the room and
//      one dropping it. (A deck voice is not among them: in today's world clone no
//      sampled instant puts a voice on the ferry's deck — heardFromV2 answers null
//      at all of them — so the deck path stays position-projection.test.mjs's,
//      over fixture marks; the room does not change heardFromV2.)
