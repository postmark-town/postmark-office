// next-crossing.test.mjs — the next crossing's time on the doorstep and on the
// send receipt, so a writer knows whether a letter makes this crossing or the
// next (postmark#2922).
//
// THE FALSIFIER THE ISSUE NAMES: a receipt minted at T names the FIRST crossing
// after T. Pinned as a property over a sweep of instants, not at three hand-
// picked times, because the wrong derivations (the crossing after next, the
// current interval's start, a boat on the settlement's clock) all agree with
// the right one at SOME instants and never at all of them.
//
// THE FLIP, run 2026-09-18 against commit `bba0361` of this branch:
// in src/crossings.mjs § nextCrossingAt, `currentCrossing(n) + 1` → `+ 2` —
// the doorstep and every receipt name the crossing AFTER next — and the
// property below reds on the first instant ("named a crossing that is not the
// first after T"); the equality with write.mjs's `nextCrossing` reds with it,
// since the two are one derivation now.
