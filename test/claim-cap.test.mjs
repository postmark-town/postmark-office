// claim-cap.test.mjs — the claim desk's hourly mint ceiling actually bites.
//
// WHY ITS OWN FILE AND ITS OWN SERVER. The cap is per-IP and in-memory, so it
// is process state shared by every test in a file: a ceiling test living beside
// the desk's other tests would both starve them and depend on how many of them
// ran first — testing the order of a file rather than the door. A fresh server
// on its own port is the only way to count from zero.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. The lane's flip run deleted the call that RECORDS a
// mint and every test stayed green: the desk's other cap test proves refusals
// do not spend a resident's budget, and nothing at all proved the budget was
// ever spent. A rate limit that never limits is a rate limit nobody is
// keeping, and the delete flip is what found it.
//
