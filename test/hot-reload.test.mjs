// hot-reload.test.mjs — the office picks up a rebuilt index without restarting.
//
// The tick used to end with `systemctl restart postmark-office`, because the
// boot-time handle in server.mjs WAS the data. That restart killed every live
// MCP session four times an hour. These tests are the receipt that it can come
// out: a spawned office, a real file swapped underneath it, and the door
// answering the new sha with nobody having reconnected.
//
// The box renames (deploy/office-rehydrate.sh: `mv -f office.db.new office.db`,
// a new inode); Windows cannot rename over an open handle at all (EPERM), so
// there a swap overwrites the same inode's bytes instead. The watcher has to
// notice BOTH, which is why its stamp is (ino, mtime, size) and not the inode
// alone. The rebuilt-index swap renames wherever the platform allows it, as the
// box does; the recovery swap below always overwrites in place.
//
