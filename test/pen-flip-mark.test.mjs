// pen-flip-mark.test.mjs — LANE SIX OF THE PEN FLIP (W2_PEN=…,mark; runbook C6).
//
// The mark lane is the candle, and the only lane the flip refused for
// UNREADINESS rather than ruling. `FLIP_REFUSED.mark` said why, verbatim:
//
//   "its candle half must ride penWrite's own transaction"
//
// and the runbook's own NO-GO said what flipping it by flag alone would do:
// *"would write acts with no docket, which is F2 self-inflicted."* So this file
// asks the four questions the flip has to answer before the flag may name it.
//
// Every test quotes the law it asserts:
