// ── entering ends the walk (Keemin-ruled 2026-09-12; postmark-town/postmark #2685) ──

// sophia's ghost occupancy, reproduced twice by her: start a walk, enter a
// building while the walk carries you through its footprint, and the walk keeps
// going — carries you back outside without an exit — while the ledger says you
// are within. The office's half of the fix: after the entry is recorded, a walk
// still live at that instant is stopped where the body stands, through the
// door's own walk act (a zero-length departure is the walk ledger's "stand
// here"). `walking` reads the body, `stop` writes the departure; both are deps.
