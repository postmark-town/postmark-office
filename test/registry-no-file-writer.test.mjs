// registry-no-file-writer.test.mjs — ONE WRITER FOR THE TOWN'S TWO REGISTERS (POS-158).
//
// THE LAW. `tools/households.json` and `tools/github-ids.json` are a RENDERING
// of the store (019_households.sql, POS-187). Exactly one module may produce
// their bytes, and exactly one may write them to a clone. Everything else reads
// the record.
//
// WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A CONVENTION. The registry had FOUR office writers
// when this lane opened — `src/declare.mjs` (the declaration's file set),
// `src/residency.mjs` (the join PR's diff, twice: the registry and the pin),
// `src/town-drain.mjs` (the crossing) — and each was correct on its own. Put a
// drain beside them and they stop being redundant and start being a race: the
// drain renders the WHOLE registry from the table, so a second writer's row
// either vanishes at the next crossing or trips the drain's shrink guard and
// stops it. `src/registry-rows.mjs`'s header had already recorded the shape of
// the damage — two spellings of `serializePins`, one sorted and one not, "a
// declaration landing through declare.mjs's unsorted writer would append its
// new handle at the END of the file and `--check` would red on the next
// crossing". That divergence was named and left; this test is what ends it.
//
// A convention cannot hold this. The next person to add a door will reach for
// `serializeRegistry` because it is exported and it is exactly what they want,
// and nothing will tell them no. This does.
//
// ── THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS THE SERIALIZERS AND NOT THE PATHS ──────────────
//
// An earlier pass of this test grepped for the two PATH constants next to a
// write verb. It found ZERO matches — including in the drain, which spells its
// write across two lines — so it would have passed with every writer restored.
// A probe that cannot fail is not a probe (HQ: "verification probes must be
// able to fail"), so the target moved to the thing that is actually load
// bearing: THE BYTES. Both files are produced by `serializeRegistry` and
// `serializePins`, and a module that does not call either cannot write them,
// whatever it does with a path.
//
// `tools/pos158-restore-a-file-writer.sh` is the flip: it restores one real
// writer to `src/declare.mjs` and this file must red. It asserts its own match
// count and exits 1 on zero, so a flip that patched nothing cannot run green.
