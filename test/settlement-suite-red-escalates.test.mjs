//
//   node --test test/settlement-suite-red-escalates.test.mjs
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE test/settlement-escalate.test.mjs ────────────────
//
// That file proves the escalator: given a receipt it composes the right issue,
// gates the wrong receipt, caps its own list. It proves nothing at all about
// whether `deploy/settlement-auto.sh` ever CALLS it.
//
// Measured, on the reviewer's flip of PR #55: delete a call site and every
// other suite stays GREEN. The logic is proven and the wiring is not, which is
// the same shape as the 2026-09-14 instance itself — an escalator that existed,
// was correct, and was never reached. A future edit to the sweep script could
// drop a call with nothing anywhere going red.
//
// So this runs THE REAL SCRIPT. Not a stub of it, not a grep for the line: a
// whole crossing in a bottle, driven to each of its exits, asserting what each
// one said and whether it escalated.
//
// ── THE GATE SPLIT (founder-ruled 2026-09-16) ───────────────────────────────
//
// "A failed settlement should be a crisis." The crossing REFUSES only for harm
// — the world's `tools/harm-gate.mjs`, run after the sweep and before the push
// — and the grammar suite runs AFTER the push as a checker whose red is a
// warning: an issue on the first occurrence, `suite.red` on the receipt, and
// nothing held. Four exits are driven here: harm named; the gate could not run;
// a red suite after a published crossing; and the green control.
//
// The fixture world answers the harm gate with a STUB, and that is the point of
// a wiring test: the gate's own truth is proven in the world repo
// (`tools/harm-gate.test.mjs`, nine falsifiers over a real tree); this bottle
// asks only whether the script calls it, reads its exit, and says the right
// words to the right escalation before it exits.
//
// ── THE BOTTLE, AND WHY IT IS ITS OWN ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is the shape of test/settlement-source-flip.test.mjs's harness, minus
// everything that file needs and this one does not: no logging `git`/`npm`/
// `node` wrappers and no command log, because the question here is not which
// commands were issued but whether one line of output appeared.
//
// ── AND IT CANNOT REACH GITHUB ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The observable is the escalator's ISSUE-WANTED line, which it prints when it
// finds no credential. `SETTLEMENT_ESCALATE_CRED` is pointed at a path inside
// the scratch dir that is never created, so the no-credential path is taken on
// EVERY box. Without that pin this test would pass on a laptop and POST to the
// town repo on the box, where `/srv/postmark-office/.git-credentials` is exactly
// where the escalator expects it.
