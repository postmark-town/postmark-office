// The walk ledger is frozen with honor and `dynamic.db/movements` is era two.
// The write path landed working and every LIVE READ still assembled departures
// from `parseWalkLedger` alone — so on the day of the freeze, twenty-seven
// residents had an ashore record in the store that no reader consulted:
//
//   world_walkers   served them at the berth they had left (-34.5, 35.5)
//   /world/present  could not find them at all — the frame fold, reading only
//                   era one, re-derived them onto a boat that had since sailed,
//                   so they did not read as misplaced, they read as GONE
//
// One question, four derivations, live. Issue #7's disease one layer down and
// across a seam. The cure is the same: ONE function
// (`world.mjs § departuresAcrossEras`) and every site calls it.
//
// The fixture is the exact shape that broke: an era-1 line walking a resident
// onto the vessel's own footprint, and a NEWER era-2 movement setting them
// ashore. Every reader must answer ashore, and with the flag off every reader
// must answer exactly what it answered before era two existed.
