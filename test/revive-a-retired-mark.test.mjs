// revive-a-retired-mark.test.mjs — A RETIRED ROW NEVER HOLDS A NAME (POS-241 phase 1, part 1).
//
//   EMBEDDED_PG_DIR=<dir holding embedded-postgres> node --test test/revive-a-retired-mark.test.mjs
//
// THE INSTANCE. At 06:00Z 2026-09-26 window 212 held a claim re-leaving
// `mari/first-night-garland`, a slug still carried by her RETIRED row (withdrawn
// 09-25, retired at window 211). Step 1 of the clearing asked only about STANDING
// rows, step 6 INSERTed a second row under the slug, `marks.slug` is UNIQUE across
// every status — `marks_slug_key` — and the whole window rolled back: no S83.
//
// THE RULING (Keemin, 2026-09-26, docs/2026-09-26/design-notes/pos-241-one-id-for-life.md
// § Rulings 3–4 and the clarification): a mark keeps one id for life. A leave-mark
// or an amend on the author's OWN retired slug revives that row — the same id,
// standing again, the new claim's record — ruled at the clearing like a new mark.
// There is only ever one row for a slug, so the slug stays unique.
//
// THE RIG. A real Postgres (test/helpers/embedded-store.mjs) with the whole
// schema, and the real `clearing-job.mjs` run as a child under the `clearing_job`
// pen, because the job connects at import and the failure is a constraint only
// Postgres raises. No stub can stand in for `marks_slug_key`.
