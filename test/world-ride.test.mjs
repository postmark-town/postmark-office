// world-ride.test.mjs — THE POST OFFICE AS A PORTAL (postmark-town/postmark#2986).
//
//   node --test test/world-ride.test.mjs
//
// Every test carries the VERBATIM ruling it asserts. Keemin ruled this in
// conversation on 2026-09-19 and the brief quotes him in order; a test that
// quoted the brief's paraphrase would guard the paraphrase.
//
// ── WHAT IS REAL HERE AND WHAT IS A FIXTURE ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The world clone is REAL: the fold, `tools/enter-exit.mjs`, `tools/world-verbs.mjs`
// and `tools/vessel.mjs` are the ones this office deploys against, so a drift
// between the two repos reds here rather than in front of a resident.
//
// THE FIXTURE BECAME THE RECORD on 2026-09-19 at 18:31 EDT — world main
// `6625d737` (PR #113) plants `class: vehicle` on `the-town/the-post-office`,
// the `vehicle` and `ride` class marks, and the Snug mooring on the wheelhouse.
// `vehicleWorld()` below no longer patches anything: it FOLDS THE REAL WORKS
// with the world's own `tools/marks-fold.mjs`, so what these tests run against
// is the town's law rather than this lane's idea of it.
//
// ⚑ AND `WORLD/world-state.json` AT THAT SHA IS STALE, which is why the fold is
// run here rather than the committed file read. The merged PR changed the Works
// SOURCE (`WORLD/marks/**/mark.md`) and the fold is regenerated at the
// settlement — its last three commits are all "settlement: sweep …" — so at
// `6625d737` the committed fold still carries the pre-PR marks: no `class:` on
// her, three stops, no `ride` mark. `plainWorld()` reads that committed file and
// is the control every "the law gates the physics" leg needs.
//
// ⚑ AND THE STOP LIST IS FOUR, NOT FIVE. Folded off `6625d737`: the wheelhouse
// names `the-town/the-post-office` (her own berth), the Pando landing, the
// Garrison's grove wharf and the Snug mooring. Vermillion's landing and the
// brass-otter mooring are places residents have WALKED to, which is a different
// fact.
