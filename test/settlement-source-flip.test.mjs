// settlement-source-flip.test.mjs — THE ROLLBACK IS A FLIP, AND HERE IS THE PROOF.
//
//   node --test test/settlement-source-flip.test.mjs
//
// ── WHAT IS UNDER TEST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// G1 puts a switch in the crossing: `SETTLEMENT_SOURCE=store` folds from the
// register, `SETTLEMENT_SOURCE=git` takes the original path for one crossing.
// The plan of record calls that switch the rollback — "point the fold back at
// git for that crossing" — and the whole swap is scheduled on the strength of
// it. A rollback nobody has exercised is a comment.
//
// The claim my brief states is that with `git`, "the chain is byte-identical to
// the train's". A literal byte comparison of the two SCRIPTS cannot be the
// instrument: this branch adds lines to the file, so that comparison is false by
// construction and would have to be weakened until it passed. What the sentence
// actually means, and the only thing that matters at 05:45Z, is that the
// rollback crossing DOES THE SAME THINGS. So the instrument here is the sequence
// of external commands each script issues — every `git`, `node` and `npm`
// invocation with its full argument list, in order — captured by putting stub
// wrappers ahead of the real binaries on PATH.
//
// The train's script is read out of git from the current open train: by
// default the newest `origin/train/*` ref by name, or `TRAIN_REF` when release
// tooling deliberately pins one. The baseline follows the train instead of a
// calendar literal, so this instrument cannot decay merely because a week turned.
//
// ── THE CAN-FAIL FLIP ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// F-flip below is the control. It removes the ghost sweep from an otherwise
// identical git crossing and proves the relation check notices the missing safety
// net. A guard that has never been shown to fail is a green light wired to nothing.
