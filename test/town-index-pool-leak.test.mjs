// town-index-pool-leak.test.mjs — POS-370's falsifier: switch 2's quest board
// never holds a store connection while it waits for another.
//
//   node --test test/town-index-pool-leak.test.mjs      (WORLD_CLONE=<a world clone> for the last two)
//
// 2026-10-04: with TOWN_INDEX_READS=store on prod, nine office_api sessions sat
// "idle in transaction" for 81 and 48 minutes, every one last running the quest
// board's town_quest_progress read, and the office's index reads stalled behind
// them for an hour. The board read its progress row inside the pen's READ ONLY
// transaction and then, still holding it, asked the world whether the
// resident's home stands; with the kept positions on, that world read rebuilds
// the positions projection through officeRead, a SECOND connection from the
// same pool of three. Three boards held all three and waited for a fourth.
//
// Every test here runs the board's doors CONCURRENTLY against a real Postgres
// and a pen pool of prod's size (three), through the branches a board takes (a
// good row, a bent row, no row, the town's board with no resident, a world read
// that throws, a read the store refuses mid-transaction), and asserts:
//   · every read answered, inside a deadline (a drained pool never answers);
//   · the pool has nothing checked out and nobody waiting afterwards;
//   · no session of office_api is idle in a transaction afterwards.
//
// The first test needs only the store and the town clone: its world read is a
// stand-in that asks the pen, as the projection's rebuild does. The last two run
// the REAL world read (WORLD_POSITIONS=1, WORLD_MOVEMENT_V2=1, a world clone),
// in this process and through a spawned office's GET /quests/{h}; without
// WORLD_CLONE they skip and say so.
