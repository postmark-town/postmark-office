//
// ── WHAT IS UNDER TEST ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The rehearsal copy could clear a window but not cross it, because after the
// harm gate the crossing published unconditionally. The dry leg is the same
// script to the same receipt with every write that leaves the run withheld and
// named. Each withheld writer has one test below, and each test is paired with
// a CONTROL crossing in the same bottle with DRY unset, which shows the writer
// is live there. A "nothing was written" that was never shown to be something
// that COULD be written is a gate wired to nothing.
//
// ── THE BOTTLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The store path cannot run in `settlement-source-flip.test.mjs`'s fixture (it
// refuses for want of a store), so this one points OFFICE_ROOT at a fixture
// office: the receipt, the history, the surveyed reading and the retry are the
// REAL files, copied; the store tools, the registry pair and the escalation are
// stubs that log their argv and, when not told to be dry, WRITE the way the
// real tool writes — the photograph is the REAL writer and commits through the
// real penCommit, the retirement writes a store row, the escalation files.
//
// The two tools whose own dry runs are trusted here are pinned on their own
// ground: state-log-write's `dryRun` by test/state-log-write.test.mjs W6, and
// retire-unpublished's `--dry-run` by the last test in this file, which runs the
// REAL tool against a port nothing listens on.
