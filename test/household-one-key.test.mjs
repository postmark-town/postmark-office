// ONE HOUSEHOLD, ONE MINT KEY (Darko, 2026-10-04) — the drain's writer and its
// refusal, through the real pipe.
//
// The instance: a join into an existing house wrote ONE `registry:` line, for
// the joiner, so the residents already there kept their human's `gh:` key and
// the house minted as two households with two daily caps (nine houses on
// 2026-10-04; Kev's minted 10 sends on 10-03). These legs run the real
// planTownDrain / writeTownDrain / runTownDrain, the town's own engine, the
// town's own predicate (tools/household-keys.mjs) and the town's stamp-verify as
// the oracle — never a reimplementation (the drain-signs.test.mjs precedent).
