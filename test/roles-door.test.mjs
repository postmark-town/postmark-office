// roles-door.test.mjs — the role gate over the REAL HTTP door.
//
// test/roles.test.mjs proves the gate's logic. This file proves the WIRING,
// which is a different claim and needs its own receipt: a gate that is correct
// and never called is a gate that does nothing, and the module test cannot tell
// those apart. Everything here goes through `fetch` against a spawned
// `src/server.mjs`.
//
// The proof door is `/metrics/mail` — chosen as the most boring credentialed-
// or-not read the office has. Which doors are gated FOR REAL is the founder's
// call; this file only demonstrates that one wiring behaves.
//
