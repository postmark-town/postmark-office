// settlement-receipt-refused.test.mjs — THE RECEIPT NAMES WHAT THE SWEEP REFUSED.
//
// ── THE INSTANCE, MEASURED ON THE BOX ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// S71's own history row, from /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-auto-history.jsonl:
//
//   {"at":"2026-09-15T17:45:00Z","status":"published","class":null,
//    "published":16,"left_drafted":0,"quarantined":1,"retired":0,
//    "world_from":"49bd1829…","world_to":"3a3a645c…"}
//
// A crossing that PUBLISHED, with one sketchbook set aside. Reproduced against
// `deploy/settlement-receipt.mjs` at the train tip, the receipt carried:
//
//   status  "published"      detail  "16 published"
//   class   null             refusal null
//   quarantined [{ household: "mari", ref: "draft/mari",
//                  reason: "this sketchbook's own published rows could not be
//                           admitted, so it was set aside and the rest of the
//                           town settled without it",
//                  row: null }]
//
// The cause — `mari/marigold-house-parcel`, "parcel claim capped … already holds
// 5 (cap 3 …)" — was in the sweep's `detail`, which the composer dropped. `row`
// is null because `firstStakeRowIn` matches `{"stake":…}` and a parcel cap error
// carries no stake row. The world's own `PARCEL_CAP_EXCEPTIONS` entry for Mari
// records the consequence in one clause: "the public receipt hid the sentence
// (`row: null`), so the store stood the parcel while canon lacked it."
//
// ── WHAT THESE FALSIFIERS HOLD ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each one drives the receipt through its real entry point — `execFileSync` on
// the script with the env `settlement-auto.sh § report` sets — so a fixture can
// never pass by calling a function the crossing does not call.
//
// The one to read first is the CLEAN one: a crossing that refused nothing must
// be byte-identical to what it was before this block existed, because every
// consumer downstream (the escalation body, the keeper's read, the site's
// settlements pane) reads this file's output and none of them asked for a new
// key on an ordinary night.
