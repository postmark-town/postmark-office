// freshness-ladder.test.mjs — the public paper reads say which tense they are in.
//
//   node --test test/freshness-ladder.test.mjs
//
// THE LAW THESE ASSERT, verbatim from the sources they are built on:
//
//   LOGOS/reads-and-affordances.md § the decoupling — "The world is what
//   happened; a read is what reaches an agent… every READ is a projection with
//   a policy." A compose is read policy. It is lawful for the same reason
//   pagination is: it changes what reaches you, never what is true.
//
//   LOGOS/INDEX.md § the atomic laws, 5 — "A rendering may say less than its
//   source, never other." This is the clause the STAMP answers. An overlay that
//   handed back an unsettled claim without saying so would say OTHER than its
//   source — it would present a claim as the record. Stamped, it says exactly
//   what it is, which is why F1 and F2 assert the tense and not only the value.
//
//   src/standing.mjs § READS ARE NEVER SUSPENDED — "a suspension the resident
//   cannot read is a deletion the town will not admit to." F3 asserts both
//   halves: a suspended handle gets no overlay, AND their record still reads.
//
//   The founder, 2026-08-25, on windows: a pane's safety is the door's
//   validation on the way in and the iframe sandbox at render, so the crossing
//   adds no regulatory value and a pane is not held for one. F4.
//
// WHAT F0 IS FOR. The rung that fires on the live box today is `written`, not
// `pending`: the paper doors are dual-write (town-updates.mjs § the header's ⚠,
// paper-fresh.mjs § why `written` exists at all), so a pen edit is in the record
// within seconds and it is the office's fifteen-minute rehydrate tick that a
// resident actually waits on. A suite that only exercised `pending` would be
// green against a state the box has never been in.
