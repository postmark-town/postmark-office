// leave-door-region-filed-parcel.test.mjs — POS-88's law on the door that runs.
//
// THE INSTANCE (#2888): Current the reader re-amended `the-keepers-flat` — his
// parcel, canon since 2026-08-24, FILED under the founder's region tree at
// `WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/the-doubled-coast/the-keepers-flat/mark.md` —
// and the door answered "your household already holds four parcels — parcel
// claiming is capped at three per household". The 409 never fired. He bounced
// AFTER POS-88 / #2614 had already ruled that an amendment is not a claim.
//
// #2888 FIRST READ THAT AS AN ID MISMATCH: the door computes `<by>/<slug>` while
// the record's id is its region path, so the standing mark is never found,
// `exists` is false, and the amend falls through the cap as a fresh claim. That
// reading does not hold, and LEGS 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are what killed it.
//
// A mark's id is `<by>` plus the LEAF directory name, never its path.
// `tools/marks-fold.mjs` in the world engine builds it — `slug =
// basename(nodeDir)` (L318), `rec.id = by + "/" + slug` (L331) — and says so in
// its own comment: "id = by + leaf". `WORLD/world-state.json`, the only canon
// `canonForGuards()` reads, carries all 92 of the town's parcels at two-segment
// ids, including at the sha #2888 measured. The region tree is a FILING
// location, not an id namespace. The door FOUND the flat every time.
//
// THE REAL CAUSE: `journalLeaveMark`'s parcel block had no `!amending` guard. It
// had only `m.id !== id`, which stops the mark being amended from counting
// ITSELF and does nothing else — so a household at or over the cap could not
// amend ANY held parcel, region-filed or not. POS-88 ruled the law on the 09-14
// instance and landed it 2026-09-15 in `6f7a889a`, in `src/leave-exec.mjs` — the
// condemned git-era door — and nowhere else. One law, two holders; the fix at
// one left the other's falsifiers green, because they drive the other executor.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC IS THE TELL, and it is why the exclusion is not the fix.
// Current's household holds FIVE parcels across seven handles; the exclusion
// dropped the flat and left FOUR — the very number he was shown. That count was
// the exclusion WORKING. Under #2888's reading nothing would have been excluded
// and he would have been told five.
//
// THE FIX (src/world.mjs, the parcel block): `if (!amending && mine >= cap)`.
//
// THE CAN-FAIL FLIP: remove `!amending` → LEG 2 and LEG 4 red (403 "already
// holds 3 parcels"), every other leg green. Run receipt in the hotfix PR.
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF THE LAW, asserted so the guard cannot widen into a repeal:
// LEG 6 (new ground is still capped) and LEG 7 (a slug is unique per author, so
// `amending` cannot be reached by naming someone else's).
