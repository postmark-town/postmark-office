// world2-rehearsal-dry.test.mjs — THE RUNNER CROSSES WHAT IT CLEARED, DRY (POS-242 item 2).
//
//   node --test test/world2-rehearsal-dry.test.mjs
//
// The rehearsal runner used to stop at the clearing and print a list of reasons
// it could not go further. Now it runs the TREE's own settlement-auto.sh under
// SETTLEMENT_DRY=1 against the copy and reads that crossing's receipt. What is
// held here:
//
//   · the environment the runner hands the crossing — built from nothing, the
//     office's pen on the copy's URL, prod's modes, its own clone and receipt;
//   · runDryLeg driving a REAL settlement-auto.sh (the bottle's fixture office,
//     test/helpers/settlement-bottle.mjs) to a dry receipt with nothing on origin;
//   · the three ways it must refuse to call something a rehearsal: no script, a
//     script that predates the dry leg, a receipt that does not say dry — and a
//     stale receipt from the last run is never read as this one's.
//
// The CLI's own path (the copy, the pen check) needs a Postgres that is a copy
// of prod's, so it runs on the box; its parts are these.
