// claim-lands-in-an-open-window.test.mjs — A CLAIM MADE WHILE THE CLEARING RUNS IS
// JUDGED (POS-404, postmark-office#349).
//
//   node --test test/claim-lands-in-an-open-window.test.mjs
//
// THE RACE. The door read the open window with no lock. While the clearing held
// window N (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`), the door still saw N as open, its INSERT's
// foreign-key check waited on the clearing's row lock, and once the clearing
// committed the claim went into N, which was now closed. The clearing had read
// its pending list before the claim existed, the next clearing reads only its own
// window, and the docket view hides closed windows: pending for good, never
// judged. The stake's promotion had it wider, because a draft put forward in the
// window it was composed in moves no `window_id`, so no key check waits at all.
//
// THE RIG. A real Postgres with the whole schema; the door's own
// `claimTxFromJournal` / `promoteDraftOnStake` as `office_api`, and the real
// `clearing-job.mjs` as `clearing_job`. The clearing is held mid-judgement by a
// row lock on the one claim it is judging, taken by this test as the owner; each
// step waits on `pg_locks` (visible to every role) rather than on a clock.
