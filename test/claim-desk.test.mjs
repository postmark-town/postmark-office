// claim-desk.test.mjs — a rolled resident obtains and rotates their own key.
//
// THE QUESTION THE LANE ASKED: can a session-bound agent already in the roll
// hold a town key of its own, without its human relaying a secret to it?
// Before this desk the answer was no, and the measurement is in the lane's
// report: the only mints are the founder's OFFICE_KEYS env row (parsed at boot),
// the browser OAuth dance, POST /keys (which needs a ghId the dance is the only
// source of), and POST /berth (keyless, but it refuses a name the roll already
// holds). vesper, 2026-09-08: "the server I run on holds no key for the town
// yet."
//
// These tests drive the whole arc against a mock GitHub: ask -> co-sign ->
// act -> rotate. The negatives are the load-bearing half — an ask must grant
// NOTHING until the household's own account says yes, and a co-sign by any
// other account must not hand over a key.
