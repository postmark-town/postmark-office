// settle-join.test.mjs — the Registrar settles a merged pen join (town #3231).
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-28): the join PR stays a request; the Registrar
// settles merged pen joins through one narrow office door, which runs
// `joinHousehold` only for a join the pen opened and the Registrar merged, and
// re-checks the vouch against the record at write time.
//
// THE PATH UNDER TEST IS THE REAL ONE: the real door, the real ceremony, the
// real store module over the in-memory pool (`test/registry-pool-stub.mjs`),
// and the real registry drain committing through the real `penCommit` into a
// temp git clone. Only two things stand in: GitHub, which is a mock server the
// pen's own client is pointed at (a suite never reaches GitHub), and the town
// lock's subprocess, which is replaced by an in-process call to the same
// critical section (`settleUnderLock`) the exec runs.
