// roll-union.test.mjs — step 10: the office learns to ask about everyone, and

//
// Both halves serve law already on the record; the clauses are cited by id
// rather than restated, because a test that paraphrases a node is a second copy
// of the constitution:
//
//   the-town/the-standing-porch  (resident class) — "the quay, when the record
//       places them nowhere else." The engine answers that correctly as of world
//       fd965b7c. This suite is about the office ASKING about the residents it
//       answers for.
//   the-town/the-disclosure      (logos) — "refuse or disclose absent inputs;
//       never quietly substitute." Both halves lean on it: a walkers answer
//       given no roll says so, and a degraded world read must never be dressed
//       up as a resident's missing paperwork.
//
// Written before the fix and red against office main ac2b43f5.
