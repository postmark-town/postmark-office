// The CLI-guard falsifier — every module with a CLI tail, both faces.
//
// THE CLASS (2026-09-08, found twice in one night, in two lanes). A tool module
// with a CLI tail runs that tail at IMPORT unless guarded; a process.exit() in
// the tail kills the importer, and the whole importing test file vanishes as one
// failing unit ("tests 1, pass 0, fail 1") instead of one red assertion. The
// guard most tools carried — `pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href ===
// import.meta.url` — is FALSE when the entry path reaches the file through a
// Windows junction (the ESM loader realpaths the entry; argv[1] is not), so the
// tool exits 0 having done nothing (HQ memory `junctions-defeat-main-guards`,
// 2026-09-05: 33 fixture reds). The office's sound idioms are the basename
// compare (src/world-drain.mjs) and the realpath compare
// (world2/tools/await-clearing.mjs); this lane converted every fragile guard to
// the latter. (The realpath exemplar was world2/tools/dispatcher.mjs until the
// subscription was parked on 2026-09-10 — the idiom outlived the file that
// taught it, and every citation in this repo was repointed with it.)
//
// FACE ONE — the import is inert. For every tool, a small importer
// (test/helpers/cli-guard-importer.mjs) is spawned as the ENTRY and imports the
// tool; it is spawned twice, at its plain path and through a junction so that
// process.argv[1] carries the exact shape the old guards failed on. The proof
// that nothing ran is that stdout is the importer's sentinel line and nothing
// else, and the exit is 0. The import happens in a CHILD so that a regression
// is one legible red here rather than this file vanishing — the shape of the
// vanish is recorded in the lane report, not reproduced by design.
//
// FACE TWO — isMain fires when the tool IS the entry. A guard that is never
// true is a tool that does nothing and exits 0. Each tool is spawned as the
// entry, again plain and through a junction, with the cheapest arguments that
// make its tail speak (a --help, a usage refusal, a missing-file refusal) and
// the test asserts the tail's own words and exit code. Nothing here reaches a
// network, a database, or a file outside a temp dir: every proof stops at the
// tool's first refusal. The junction arm is the one that matters (the atlas
// lane's reviewer, 2026-09-08): by its real path the old guard passes every
// check, and only through a junction does it fall silent — "produced no output
// and exited 0" is the named red, and a grep for the idiom cannot see it.
//
// THE ROSTER IS LIVE. The manifest below is checked against a scan of src/,
// tools/, world2/ and deploy/ for anything carrying an entry guard; a new
// guarded tool that is not listed here fails the roster test, and a listed
// tool that has lost its guard fails it too. The denominator is read from the
// tree, never assumed.
