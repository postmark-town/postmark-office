// position-projection.test.mjs — the projection equals the derivation (POS-264).
//
// ── WHAT IS ON TRIAL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `src/position-projection.mjs` keeps ONE departure per resident — the
// governing one — where every door used to re-read both eras of the record.
// The claim is that nothing a door says changes, because the engine itself
// reads nothing but the governing record (`walk.mjs § currentDeparture`, the
// last record for a handle; `where-is.mjs § whereIs`, that record or the fold).
//
// So the falsifier is a REPLAY. Acts are built one at a time with the live
// `walkEntry`, filed into a fixture store exactly as `normalizeRow` writes them
// and `pg` hands them back, and after every one:
//
//   RECORD      the projection, kept current only by `record(recordOfMovement)`
//               in the same step, holds byte for byte what a fresh derivation
//               (`departuresAcrossEras` over the real ledger + the store) folds to.
//   PLACED      `everyonePlaced` over the projection equals `everyonePlaced`
//               over the whole record, at instants mid-walk and after arrival.
//   PRESENCE    `positionsAt` reading the projection equals `positionsAt`
//               reading the entities table + the store.
//   HEARING     `heardFromV2` reads no walk record at all (POS-261): a voice
//               is heard from the position floor, the store never asked.
//   NEAR        the grid's `near` equals a scan of every row, at instants that
//               carry a walker across cells and into arrival.
//   DOOR        `/world/walkers` answers the same with the flag on as off,
//               at an instant with walkers on the road and again after they
//               have arrived.
//   KEPT        (POS-284) the placement kept per epoch answers what
//               `everyonePlaced` answers at every instant, having placed the
//               whole town once and only the walkers after; `positionsAt` over
//               it answers what it answers without it.
//
// ── THE FLIP (run after the commit; the red line goes in the report) ─────────
//
// In `src/position-projection.mjs § governingOf`, keep each handle's FIRST
// record instead of its last (`if (!out.has(d.handle)) out.set(...)`). RECORD,
// PLACED, PRESENCE and DOOR go red: a resident who walked twice is answered from
// the leg they superseded. HEARING stays green under that flip, and that is the
// POS-247 fact it pins rather than a gap: no walk record can frame a voice, so
// which record the fold is handed cannot move one.
//
// POS-284's flips. (1) In `createPlacement § rows`, return the kept rows without
// re-placing the drifting (`if (!k.drifting.size) return out;` →
// `return out;`): PRESENCE, KEPT and DOOR go red, a walker answered where they
// stood when the town was first placed. (2) In `world.mjs § placedAt`, drop
// `${epoch}|` from the key: DOOR goes red at the recorded walk, a resident who
// set off answered from their ground.
//
