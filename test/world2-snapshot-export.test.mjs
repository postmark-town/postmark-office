// world2-snapshot-export.test.mjs — the notary pen's decisions, without a database.
//
// Everything `snapshot-export.mjs` DECIDES is pure with respect to Postgres: how
// an act becomes an archived line, how a mark becomes a file, which acts belong
// to which window, what the certification binds, and — the one that matters most
// — whether a re-derivation that disagrees with an existing archive is an
// overwrite or a refusal. Those are the tests here. The rows are shaped the way
// `pg` hands them over (bigint and numeric as TEXT, timestamptz as Date, jsonb as
// objects), because a test that fed the code prettier inputs than the driver does
// would prove something about a different program.
//
// The DB half is proved on the box instead, by `--verify` and its red-proof; see
// world2/tools/README.md § The notary.
//
// EVERY LAW ASSERTED BELOW IS QUOTED WHERE IT IS ASSERTED. The two that carry the
// file, both from the gold plan (postmark-world-2.md § 2):
//
//   "each closed window exported append-only into `archives/` — machine-written
//    but single-pen, frozen-on-write, an input never re-derived-into"
//
//   "the office cannot rewrite history without the repo catching it"
