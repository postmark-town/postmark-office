// ring-wins-standpoint.test.mjs — AN ARRIVED WALKER STANDS WHERE THE ROAD ENDED.
//
//   WORLD_CLONE=<a world clone> node --test test/ring-wins-standpoint.test.mjs
//
// Founder-ruled 2026-09-11, beside "ring wins everywhere". The office half of
// that ruling is one line in `world-movement.mjs § movementStandpoint`, and this
// is the bug it closes, measured on wright's own case:
//
//   wright walked to wright/the-trueing-terrace. The rim arrival ended at
//   (1022.3, -1669) — the box's near edge, which by the terrace's 12-point ring
//   is his neighbour's field. `positionAt` says he is there. The STANDPOINT said
//   he was at (967, -2450.5), the terrace's anchor, 783 m away, because
//   `foldFrames` sets `local = endWorld` for anyone ashore and `endWorld` is the
//   record's `toward` — a rim walk's `toward` being the mark's centre.
//
//   The enter door measures from the standpoint. So it let him through a door he
//   was nowhere near: `enterExitPlan` saw a walker already inside the target,
//   never set `walk`, and the reach check had nothing to run on.
//
// THE LAW THE REACH CHECK QUOTES, verbatim from `world-crossings.mjs`: "A DOOR
// IS ENTERED FROM WITHIN ITS REACH (founder-ruled 2026-08-27, option A of the
// R15 collision — found on the first dev walk: 'you can enter things when you
// aren't even there')." The rule said "from its DOORSTEP" until 2026-09-11,
// when the founder took that word back for the resident's own front step.
//
// WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE, and has its own case below: aboard a CARRIER the frame
// still composes. The road's end is a quay she left hours ago.
