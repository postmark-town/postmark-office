//
// ── THE FAILURE THIS RETIRES (postmark#2978, POS-134) ───────────────────────
//
// The Base rail had the card rail's #2973, and had it worse. `watch()` scans
// `from = cursor + 1` and returns `cursor = to`, the deepest block the tick
// could safely read. `resolveArrivals` HOLDS a fresh arrival for its grace
// (`graceMs = CROSSING_MS`, twelve hours). The timer is every ten minutes. So
// tick 1 sees the arrival and holds it, the cursor steps past its block, and
// tick 2 — ten minutes later — scans from the cursor and cannot see it.
//
// Not "when a newer row shares a listing", the way the card rail's was. EVERY
// arrival, on its SECOND tick, always. The two-tick probe at
// docs/2026-09-19/pos-2973/usdc-orphan-probe.mjs reads it out loud:
//
//   TICK 1  cursor -> 1005 {"hold":1, …}
//   TICK 2  cursor -> 1005 {"hold":0, …}
//
// over one arrival that nobody touched in between.
//
// NOTHING HERE MOVES MONEY. This rail only ever SEES — the unit records no
// ledger row and holds no lock. What the orphaning cost was the arrival's place
// on `arrivals.json`, which `tools/funding-report.mjs` reads for the operator's
// Base queue and its anomaly rows; and it is why `SINK_AGE_DAYS = 7` could
// never come due on an ordinary tick, since an arrival is gone from the scan
// long before it is seven days old.
//
// THE CURSOR IS FOR FINDING NEW BLOCKS. THE JOURNAL IS FOR REMEMBERING HELD
// ARRIVALS — the card rail's own sentence, and its answer is the one mirrored
// here: `usdc-intake.jsonl` beside the state file, every seen-and-unresolved
// row decided again each tick whatever the cursor says.
//
// ── WHAT EACH CASE IS FOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   F1a the bug itself, through the QUIET branch — which is the branch the real
//       probe takes, because ten minutes after a tick the safe head has often
//       not moved past the cursor at all. RED at the train tip.
//   F1b the bug itself, through the SCANNING branch — the head has moved on and
//       the scan simply starts past the arrival. RED at the train tip. The two
//       branches are separate lines of code and a fix wired into one of them
//       ships looking fully tested.
//   F2  THE CONTROL. The same two ticks with NO journal still lose it. Green on
//       both sides by construction: it is what makes F1's green mean "the
//       journal did it" rather than "the harness never reproduced anything".
//   F3  the grace comes due behind the cursor: a remembered arrival is
//       WITNESSED into `todo` on a later tick. This is the half the operator
//       actually waits on.
//   F4  SINK_AGE_DAYS is reachable on an ordinary tick — an unregistered
//       arrival eight days old, remembered, sinks with the founder's flag ON.
//       It asserts the flag's default separately so it cannot pass by flipping
//       the rail's posture.
//   F5  an arrival the journal records as WITNESSED is not decided again at
//       all. The ledger's ref-uniqueness would bounce a second write anyway;
//       the watcher must not even try.
//   F6  freshness: an arrival in BOTH the scan and the journal is decided from
//       the LIVE decode. A journal row is a snapshot; letting it win would
//       freeze the arrival at the moment it was worst understood.
//   F7  the non-regression: the cursor is still computed from the scan alone. A
//       journal row must not move it. This is a fix TO a cursor bug.
//   F8  a tick that cannot reach the chain throws before anything is decided,
//       so it returns no rows to journal and no cursor to persist.
//   F9  `unresolvedSeen` is the whole rule, and it is pure.
//   F10 the journal's two functions round-trip on a real file, and a torn line
//       is surfaced rather than thrown.
//   F11 the CLI's wiring, as SOURCE TEXT. Explicitly the weakest case here —
//       see its own comment for what it does and does not prove.
//
// ── WHICH OF THE TWELVE DISCRIMINATE, so twelve green is not read as twelve
//    guards (measured, both flips run one variable at a time) ───────────────
//
//   Flip 1, drop the journal union entirely: reds F1a, F1b, F3, F4, F7 — five.
//   Flip 2, restore the unconditional quiet-branch early return: reds F1a
//   ALONE, which is what that case was written for and is the proof the two
//   halves of this change are separately held.
//
//   F2 and F8 stay green under both ON PURPOSE: F2 is the control (the
//   orphaning is real on either side) and F8 is the throw path, which this
//   change does not touch. F5 and F6 pass trivially when nothing is
//   remembered — they pin the SHAPE of the fix, not the bug, and their own
//   flips would be "let a witnessed row back in" and "let the snapshot win".
//   F9/F10/F11 are the rule, the file and the wiring, and red at the train tip
//   on the symbols not existing rather than on behaviour.
