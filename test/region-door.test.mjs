// region-door.test.mjs — GET /regions/{slug}: one region, whole and uncapped.
//
//   node --test test/region-door.test.mjs
//
// WHY THIS DOOR EXISTS. The World page's region column wanted to show a region's
// own page and found nothing that served one. `/regions` is a LIST and it caps
// like one: it takes the founder's first non-heading LINE and slices it at 200
// characters, so the cut lands mid-word and every later paragraph is unreachable
// at any length. On the live town six of the thirteen regions sit at exactly the
// cap. The prose was in the office's own index the whole time — the `regions`
// row stores `body` whole — and this door serves it.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES, and each has a case below:
//   UNCAPPED          — the cap is the entire reason the door exists
//   KEYED BY SLUG     — the viewer holds the slug, not the founder's handle
//   EMPTY, NOT 404    — a region whose founder wrote no page still EXISTS
//
// It runs the real `src/hydrate.mjs` over a throwaway town and then the real
// `src/server.mjs` over that index, because status codes are the claim here and
// a unit test on the query would prove the object while saying nothing about
// what the door answers. The flip that reds the first case: cap `description`
// in `regionOne` at 200 the way the list does.
