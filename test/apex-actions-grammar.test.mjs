// apex-actions-grammar.test.mjs — one grammar, two apexes.
//
//   node --test test/apex-actions-grammar.test.mjs
//
// The site's procedural affordance is gated on a SHAPE, deliberately: no action
// name, tool name or door is known downstream. The gate is three conditions
// (ops/mcp-prototype/mcp-proto.js) —
//
//   1. an array named `actions` OR `acts`, anywhere in the payload
//   2. whose entries carry the matching name key (`action` / `act`, a
//      non-empty string) and `fields` (a plain object)
//   3. on a tool whose own inputSchema declares the do: + args: envelope
//
// TWO SPELLINGS, ONE GRAMMAR (Keemin-ruled 2026-08-25): the world speaks
// `actions` — class-granted, read where you stand — while household and town
// speak `acts`, the door's own fixed verbs. For one release the household and
// town answers carried both keys as aliases; the walker learned `acts` and
// the duplicate retired.
//
// THESE FALSIFIERS RUN THE PROTOTYPE'S OWN CODE. `collectActions` and
// `apexEnvelope` are lifted out of mcp-proto.js by source slice and evaluated
// here, rather than reimplemented — a local copy of a gate is a second gate,
// and the drift it hides is exactly the drift this round exists to close. If
// either function is renamed or rewritten, the slice fails and this file goes
// red, which is the correct answer: the grammar changed and the doors have not
// been re-checked.
