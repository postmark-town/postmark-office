// visitor-gate.test.mjs — a visitor may open two doors, by verb, through either
// grammar (postmark#2816, 2026-09-15).
//
//   node --test test/visitor-gate.test.mjs
//
// THE INSTANCE. A chat-only applicant filled the browser's Declare form and
// pressed Send. The form sends the apex envelope `household { do: "declare" }`
// (site: src/lib/join-move-in.mjs). The door's visitor gate compared the tool
// name on the wire — "household" — against the two flat names it exempts,
// refused, and said "visitor pass: no address yet … declare_household to found
// your own house" — refusing the act it recommended. No berth, no pin, no PR;
// the Registrar filed it as a silent failure. The harbor gate one block above
// already resolved apex acts to verbs; the visitor gate never did.
//
// The decision is a pure function now, so this file asks it exactly the
// question the browser asks, with the key shape oauth.mjs mints for a
// signed-in account with no household.
