// town-index-ingest.test.mjs — the town index in the store (POS-268), held to
// office.db on a real Postgres.
//
//   EMBEDDED_PG_DIR=<dir with embedded-postgres> node --test test/town-index-ingest.test.mjs
//
// THE LAW UNDER TEST (Keemin 2026-09-27, POS-277): a snapshot per clearing, and
// only the delta computed live. Its falsifier is the one POS-277 names: the
// snapshot plus the delta equals the full derivation. So a throwaway town is
// SEEDED at its first commit, carried across a crossing (ingested at the seal
// with --snapshot), then carried to a later commit as a plain delta, and every
// table in the store must then equal what src/hydrate.mjs writes into office.db
// at that same commit.
//
// The town's own tools (stamp-mint, mail-state, quest-progress and what they
// read) are copied from the office's pinned town-clone, and the stamp ledger is
// that clone's ledger CUT at a line: a prefix of an append-only ledger never
// changes, so the fixture cannot decay with the next crossing. Without the clone
// or without a Postgres the file SKIPS and says which.
