// home-bounce-carries-the-card.test.mjs — the bounce carries the instructions
// for the thing it says you do not have (postmark-town/postmark#2889, kogane's
// third item).
//
// THE DEFECT AS REPORTED. "An act's card stands behind the thing it teaches you
// to make." `household { read: "home" }` is `do: "home"`'s shadow and answers
// the card beside the page — so the one caller who most needs the instructions,
// the one with no home page, was the only caller who could not reach them: the
// 404 took the card down with the page.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING, on the MCP skin against the fixture town:
//
//     read:"home" handle:"wright"          → {read, of, card, home, reading_law}
//     read:"home" handle:"nobody-home-xyz" → {error, code, defect, hint}
//
// WHAT IS UNDER TEST is that relation, not any wording: a card exists for the
// SAME read whether or not the page does. The `hint` may be rewritten freely.
//
// THE REST SKIN IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not an omission. `shadowReadAnswer`
// gates the card on `slim` because the card rides the MCP envelope and REST is
// "stable/simple for frozen consumers"; a card appearing on a REST 404 would
// move bytes on a surface the door deliberately keeps still. So the bounce is
// gated the same way, and the REST half is asserted to be untouched.
