// doorstep-bundle.test.mjs — THE FALSIFIER THAT MAKES IT A BUNDLE (2026-08-25).
//
// The founder's refactor, in his words: the doorstep is "really just a bundle
// of other mcp read calls." A page that merely *resembles* six other reads is
// not that — it is six restatements that drift, and the town has already paid
// for that shape twice (HAL, July 30: "one town gives three answers"; and the
// doorstep's own `awaiting_reply`, a filtered restatement of rows the
// `correspondence` block already held).
//
// So the claim this file asserts is structural, and it is the law the bundle
// quotes from `queries.mjs § BUNDLE_LAW`:
//
//   "each segment below carries the DOMAIN of another read, called at the args
//    it names in `serves` and `args` — what that read answers about, not the
//    envelope the apex wraps it in. Nothing here is a second rendering of
//    anything — ask the named read yourself and the segment is what comes back
//    under its own key."
//
// (That sentence was re-strung 2026-08-31; the one it replaced, and why it went
// stale, are recorded at the falsifier itself further down this file.)
//
// The test asks the named read yourself. Every segment's `serves` is parsed,
// dispatched THROUGH THE REAL APEX (mcp.mjs § callTool — the same dispatcher a
// connector's call lands in, not a lookalike built for this file), and
// deep-equalled against the segment. Drift is therefore not a bug that could be
// introduced; it is a shape the suite refuses.

// shadow reads now answer the world apex's shape — the card beside the thing,
// the thing under its own key. A law that cannot tell the envelope from the
