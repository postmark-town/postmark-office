// and the live layer coming from `claims` instead of the journal.
//
// The store is a hand-built CLIENT rather than a database, exactly as

// under test is the WIRE, and a real Postgres would test the port a second time
// while proving nothing more about the door.

// CAN-FAIL: the third test IS the flip. It breaks the household spelling — the
// bare handle instead of the resolved key, which is
// `DISCLOSURES.two_household_spellings` and the falsifier's own second injected
// fault — and asserts that the duplicate is then PERMITTED. Both directions are
// asserted, so a wire that is not there cannot pass the pair.
