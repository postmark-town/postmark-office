// Falsifiers for box-rollcall.
//
// The law these assert is the founder's acceptance criterion of 2026-08-27,
// quoted verbatim wherever a test claims an alarm must fire:
//
//     "A box roll-call exists: a manifest of every unit that must run with its
//      expected heartbeat, a checker that emits ALARM for missing or stale,
//      wired into my daily operator round — and on install day it must find the
//      unread shadow-script verdict, proving it can fail. OPERATIONS.md carries
//      the law: a mechanism folds only with its runner, its liveness check, and
//      its activation owner named. 'Built' is not 'done.'"
//
// ── HOW THE FIXTURE IS BUILT, AND WHY IT IS BUILT THAT WAY ──────────────────
//
// Every test below starts from `healthy()`, which PLANTS THE HEALTHY STATE: a
// snapshot in which every live row's unit is loaded, enabled, active and ticking
// at half its allowance, every state file exists with a fresh stamp, every
// service behind a timer reports success, and every parked row's unit is honestly
// absent from the box. The first test asserts that fixture is entirely green and
// exits 0. That control is not a formality — without it, a mutation test proves
// only that the row is red, never that the MUTATION made it red, and a fixture
// that was already broken would let every falsifier below pass for the wrong
// reason.
//
// The fixture is GENERATED FROM THE SHIPPED MANIFEST rather than hand-written
// per unit. A hand-written fixture goes stale the first time somebody adds a row
// — the new unit would simply not appear in it, and every test here would keep
// passing while saying nothing at all about the new rail. Generating it means a
// manifest row that cannot be made healthy is itself a test failure.
//
// Each mutation asserts, before anything else, that it CHANGED SOMETHING. That
// check is here because of a lane in this repo where two flips reported "the
// edit changed nothing" and the reason turned out to be invisible NUL bytes in
// the source. A mutation that silently no-ops is a falsifier that proves the
// guard works when in fact the guard was never reached.
