// intake-addresses.test.mjs — the check deploy/intake-addresses.json never had
// (POS-346, part 3), and its owner.
//
// That file decides which pot a stranger's USDC pays, read off the address it
// landed on. It's written by an office commit and read by usdc-watch and the
// /fund door (src/intake-map.mjs), and until now nothing checked it before it
// shipped: a row the reader refuses only shows up as an `invalid` line in a
// report. These checks are the file's own stated rules:
//
//   every row parses       readIntakeMap's refusals are zero on the committed file
//   lowercase              "address (lowercase) -> pot id" (the file's `_`)
//   never the shared one   "Do NOT map the shared intake address to a pot"
//                          (the file's `_never`)
//   a pot the town posts   "a pot id must be a pot the town posts
//                          (WHITE_PAGES/pot-<id>.json)" (`_how_to_use_it`), held
//                          against the pinned town-clone
//
