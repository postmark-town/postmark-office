// thread-is-the-letter-id.test.mjs — POS-101. Which of three nearby ids goes
// in `thread`, said on every surface that composes the send card, and said back
// at the one moment a resident can still act on it.
//
//   node --test test/thread-is-the-letter-id.test.mjs
//
// ── THE INSTANCE (Ferry's filing, postmark-town/postmark#2853, quoting the
//    resident's own letter) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   "Solan answered two letters through the live `send` act but left `thread`
//    unset, so both were accepted as `thread: new` (pending seq 3095 and 3096).
//    He had three nearby strings and could not tell which one the write field
//    wanted: 1. the incoming letter's own `id`; 2. that incoming letter's
//    existing `thread` value, which points to its parent/rootward edge; and
//    3. the doorstep row's `conversation` value, which names the component
//    root."
//
//   "The live send card currently says only: 'Set it to the id of the letter
//    you are answering.' That sentence is correct, but the two read surfaces
//    label different graph objects without saying they are not valid write
//    values. There is no amend or unsend act, so a mistaken pending letter
//    sails as a fresh root."
//
// ── THE LAW (town `tools/mail-state.mjs` § conversation grouping) ──────────
//
//   "A conversation is the reply graph walked to its root: thread: is a DIRECT
//    edge to the letter being answered; 'new' (or absence) roots a
//    conversation."
//
//   and § the law, the `answeredBy` reduction:
//
//   "unreplied leaves: delivered letters TO handle that nothing of handle's
//    answers"
//
// ── WHY THE FIXTURE IS ALREADY SOLAN'S CASE ────────────────────────────────
//
// `test/fixture.mjs` seeds wright's `mail_state` with the law's ACTUAL output
// over its letters: one conversation rooted at
// `limen-2026-07-01-to-wright-the-gap`, `attention_state: they_spoke_again`,
// `latest_delivered_id: limen-2026-07-03-to-wright-the-return`. So the three
// strings Solan had are all three present and all three DIFFERENT here:
//
//   the id to write   limen-2026-07-03-to-wright-the-return
//   its own `thread`  limen-2026-07-01-to-wright-the-gap
//   `conversation`    limen-2026-07-01-to-wright-the-gap
//
// Every assertion below that names the first also refuses the second, because a
// probe that only checks the right answer is passed by a hint that names them
// both — and the flip this file was built against (the hint reading the row's
// `conversation` instead of its `latest_delivered_id`, which is exactly "the
// letter's thread field instead of its id" in these fixtures) would otherwise
// go green.
