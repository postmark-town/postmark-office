// join-ceremony.test.mjs — the mint, its refusals, and the writers it closed (POS-158).
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-22): the household's key is the declared slug, minted
// once at the human's co-sign, on every path into town; and, on this lane's
// STOP report, the house and the membership are TWO ROWS at TWO MOMENTS — the
// house at the co-sign, the membership at admission.
//
// THE POOL IS STUBBED, NOT MOCKED AROUND, exactly as `registry-drain.test.mjs`
// does it: `world2-acts.mjs` exports `__setPoolForTest`, and the stub answers
// the REAL queries `loadRegistryRows`, `upsertHousehold` and `upsertPin` send.
// So the path under test is the real store module, the real fold, the real
// renderer and the real drain decision — not a rehearsal of them. The stub
// holds its rows in memory and applies the upserts, which is what makes "mints
// exactly one row" a measurement rather than a count of calls.
//
// THE PEN IS INJECTED wherever one would be reached, for the reason
// `declareHousehold` has always injected its `commit`: the decision is what is
// being proven, and a real pen would want a clone, a bot identity and a remote
// to prove a branch that has nothing to do with any of them.
