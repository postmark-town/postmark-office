// read-workers.test.mjs — POS-266's two falsifiers, against real workers.
//
//   § 1  A WRITE, THEN AN IMMEDIATE READ ON A WORKER, SEES THE WRITE. The walk
//        door's own call (`world.mjs § recordMoved`) runs on this thread, and
//        the very next /world/walkers, answered by each worker, must place the
//        walker where the write put her. The workers never walked: the only way
//        they can know is the announcement.
//   § 2  KILL A WORKER AND THE OFFICE KEEPS ANSWERING. A read held by a worker
//        that dies is answered by another; reads after the death are answered;
//        the dead worker is respawned, a new thread in its slot.
//
// The workers are the pool the server starts (read-workers.mjs § startReadPool)
// running the real server module as read-role offices; this file plays the
// main thread's part, handing them requests the way server.mjs's dispatch does.
//
//   § 3  AN AGENT'S MCP READ IS ANSWERED BY A WORKER (POS-284), and a call
//        that is not one of those reads is refused by the worker even when it
//        is handed over.
//   § 4  THE MAIN THREAD HANDS THOSE READS OVER, AND ONLY THOSE: a real office
//        with one worker answers world_orient from the worker and a say from
//        its own thread.
//   § 5  THE REST LISTEN STAYS HOME TOO (POS-284's hotfix): GET
//        /world/apex?read=say, after a say on the main thread, is answered by
//        the main thread and hears it; the bare GET /world/apex still goes to
//        the worker.
//
// THE FLIPS: delete `onAnnounce("position", …)` in world.mjs and § 1 goes red;
// delete the in-flight hand-over in `startReadPool`'s exit handler and § 2's
// first leg answers 503; delete the respawn and its last leg times out. For
// POS-284: drop `&& !(IN_READ_WORKER && req.handedMcpRead && path === "/mcp")`
// from server.mjs's role gate and § 3's reads answer the role's 405; delete the
// `onlyReads` refusal in mcp.mjs and § 3's say is answered by the worker; make
// `mcpWorkerTakes` answer true for every call and § 4's say names a worker.
// For the hotfix: drop `&& !listensToVoices(path, query)` from `workerTakes`, or
// the `url.searchParams` server.mjs passes it, and § 5's listen names worker-0
// and misses the say.
//
//   § 6  READING BACK STAYS HOME TOO (POS-226): a `before:` page of the REST
//        listen is answered by the main thread, and at the door a voice from
//        before the world clone's newest settlement is never heard while the
//        voices since it page back twenty at a time. FLIPS: drop
//        `&& !listensToVoices(path, query)` from `workerTakes` and the page names
//        worker-0; drop the window filter in voices.mjs § snapshot and the older
//        voice is heard.

// ── § 7 A LETTER OPENED IN FULL IS A WRITE (POS-286, ruling (a)) ────────────

// and a read-role worker does not write. So a KEYED GET /letters/{id} or
// GET /town/apex?read=letter is answered here on the main thread, and a keyless
// one (which writes nothing) still goes to the worker. The answer's bytes are
// the same on both threads. Whether the clear lands is proved with a store in
// test/unread.test.mjs (§ 7, through the stub) and against a real Postgres in
// the lane's paperwork; this office proves the ROUTING.
