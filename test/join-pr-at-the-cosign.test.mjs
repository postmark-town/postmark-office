//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-29, Household Primary Key reopened): the office decides
// whatever a machine can decide, and a PR exists only when a person has to.
//   · An account the house already lists (or a house this account is founding
//     or naming for itself) is ADMITTED AND BOUND at the door: the card, the
//     pin, the membership and both printed registers in one pen commit, and no
//     PR (src/join-bind.mjs).
//   · An account the house has never listed still opens the held PR.
//   · A record this office cannot read refuses, and writes nothing.
//
// Before this ruling the vouched join opened a PR whose merge bound nothing
// (POS-158's "the membership lands at the crossing" — no path did), and the
// welcome pass paid the unpinned handle's house twice (Wildcat, Scout).

// commits into. The only thing that stands in is the town lock's subprocess,
// replaced by an in-process call to the same critical section the exec runs.
// `test/residency.test.mjs` keeps the half that is about the HTTP door.
