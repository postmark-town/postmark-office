// join-pr-at-the-cosign.test.mjs — the join-PR lane, under the new law (POS-158).
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-22, on this lane's STOP report): on the join-PR path
// the HOUSE is minted at the co-sign — which for `request_residency` is the
// request itself, since the verb refuses without a verified GitHub account —
// and the MEMBERSHIP lands at admission, which on this lane is the office's
// first sight of the Registrar's merge (the crossing). The PR carries the card
// and NO registry diff.
//
// ── WHY THESE TESTS LEFT `test/residency.test.mjs` ─────────────────────────
//
// That suite drives a SPAWNED office over real HTTP, and the office it spawns
// cannot reach the record: the store is Postgres, and this lane touches no
// database. Before POS-158 that did not matter, because the registry arrived
// through the mock GitHub like everything else. Now the registry IS the record,
// so every assertion about what the door decides — the house-line lint, the
// cross-house refusal, pre-vouched versus cold-B2 — would have been testing the
// degraded path instead of the law.
//
// So they moved in-process. `requestResidency` is called directly, with the
// pool stubbed (the POS-187 seam) and a pen pointed at a mock GitHub in this
// same process. Nothing is weakened: every assertion that used to ride the HTTP
// suite is here, against the REAL function, plus the ones HTTP could never make
// — that the house row landed in the record, and which rows did not.
//
// `test/residency.test.mjs` keeps the half that is genuinely about the door:
// the PR's shape over real HTTP, the dedup, the gangway, and the ruled
// behaviour when the record is unreachable.
