// `test/helpers/drain-pen.mjs` no longer points STAMP_ENGINE_DIR at somebody's
// town checkout; it writes a narrow one per run, carrying the two functions
// `town-drain` imports through that variable. Six suites now sign through that
// fixture. Nothing read it back against the town's own grammar, so it could
// drift from the law it claims to follow and every one of those six would stay
// green while doing it.
//
// The drain-signs suite is still the oracle for the town's cryptography and is
// not replaced here. This file guards the narrower thing drain-signs cannot: the
// COPY agreeing with the original.
//
// Two readers, because they fail on different days. The literal cases below run
// everywhere and never skip — the repo's own "keep them literal" rule for copied
// town grammar (src/funding.mjs § THE FUNDING SEAM). The cross-check runs the
// real engine side by side whenever a town checkout is reachable, and SKIPS
// rather than passes when it is not: a silent pass on a box that cannot reach
// the oracle is the check reaching for something easier than the behaviour.
