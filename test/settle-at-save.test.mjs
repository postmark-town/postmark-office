// settle-at-save.test.mjs — POS-5 §3's finisher: walks and crossings settle at
// the save, not per act to git main.
//
// The ruling (2026-08-22, founder): "walks + enter-exit should settle at the
// save, not per-act to git main."
//
// Until now every walk and every crossing spent ONE GIT COMMIT on world main —
// they were still arriving on main's log the morning this was written
// ("crossing: lucien exits caelum/evermoon (via world_exit)"). Behind
// WORLD_SINGLE_LOG the act writes a journal row instead and the save gives the
// record the same lines, once.
//
// ── THE BAR, AND IT IS THE WHOLE POINT ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// "the record the save writes must carry the same lines the per-act commits
//  would have (fewer commits, identical record content — assert it, not
//  eyeball it)."
//
// So the centrepiece here runs the SAME acts down both lanes and compares the
// resulting ledger BYTE FOR BYTE. Fewer commits is the win; a different record
// would be a bug wearing a win's clothes.
//
// Every test was can-fail flipped; the flips are in the handback.
//
