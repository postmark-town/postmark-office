// world2-my-marks-reads.test.mjs — `/world2/my-marks`, the portfolio twin, held
// to 1.0's own composition AND made unable to go green off the tree (POS-104).
//
// ── WHAT IS HELD TO WHAT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `world.mjs § worldMyMarks` is a COMPOSITION over three readers, and the
// composition is the part a twin can get wrong in ways nobody sees: which rows
// land under `drafts` and which under `docket`, which published marks are
// excluded because they are already backed, where the page bound falls, and
// what `counts` means when the lists beside it are cut.
//
// So the equality here is against 1.0's own DECISIONS, imported rather than
// re-expressed:
//
//   markPage    src/world.mjs   the page bound and the `withheld` naming. The
//                               twin is handed the ORIGINAL function, so a
//                               changed bound moves both doors or neither.
//   backedRow   src/world-stake.mjs   `yours`, `holder_weight`, and the `unread`
//                               sentence. Exported and pure for exactly this.
//
// A twin that re-expressed either would pass a test written against its own
// copy. This file asserts that the twin's rows ARE those functions' output.
//
// ── WHY AN EQUALITY ALONE WOULD BE WORTHLESS ────────────────────────────────
//
// 1.0 reads two working trees. A twin that quietly read the same trees would
// answer identically, and every equality would pass with the port doing
// nothing. So the fixture store carries rows that stand in NO tree:
//
//   · `wright/only-in-the-store` — a standing mark in `marks` and nowhere else
//   · `ghost-holder` — a stake in `escrow_projection` and nowhere else
//
// and the pool COUNTS what it was asked, so a door that opened neither table
// fails on the count even if its numbers looked right.
//
// ── THE FLIP, run 2026-09-17 against commit `976b3de` of this branch ─────────
//
// In `src/world2-serve.mjs`'s `world2MyMarks`, point the twin at the tree:
// replace the canon read
//
//     const { rows: markRows } = await p.query(portfolio.PORTFOLIO_MARKS_SQL, [[...handles]]);
//
// with the folded tree the 1.0 door reads —
//
//     const markRows = ((await import("./world-branches.mjs"))
//       .publishedState(WORLD_CLONE).state.marks ?? [])
//       .filter((m) => handles.has(m.by))
//       .map((m) => ({ slug: m.id, kind: m.kind, owner: m.by, household: null,
//                      body: m.body, geometry: { at: m.at, extent: m.extent }, data: { tier: m.tier } }));
//
// and 4 of these 13 go red:
//
//   not ok 7 - THE PLANTED MARK: a published row that exists only in the store reaches the answer
//     error: |-
//       the twin did not see `wright/only-in-the-store` — it is reading a tree
//
// ⚑ THE QUERY-COUNT LEG DOES NOT CATCH THIS FLIP, and that is worth knowing
// rather than discovering later: `publishedIdsFrom` and `publishedMarkFrom`
// still open `marks` for the overlay's canon half, so the count stays green
// while the PUBLISHED list is coming off a tree. Counting the store's queries is
// a weaker instrument than planting a row in it, and here is the case that
// separates them. Both legs are kept; only one of them would have failed.
//
// Restore with `git checkout -- src/world2-serve.mjs`.
//
// Run: node --test test/world2-my-marks-reads.test.mjs
