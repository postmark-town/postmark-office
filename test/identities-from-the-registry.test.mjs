// identities-from-the-registry.test.mjs — POS-350: `identities` and the store fold's households
// are the store's registry, not the world repo's WORLD/households.json.
//
// `identities` is a VIEW over `households` and `household_pins` (055). Its
// household column must be the answer the office's one deriver gives
// (src/household-deriver.mjs § resolveHouse) for every handle the registry
// knows: a house that lists the handle, else the house holding its pin's
// account, else `solo:<handle>`. The store fold's households are the same
// registry, keyed by declared slug as the world's own projector keys them.
//
// THE FLIPS: 055 as a plain table (law_ingester's, unfilled) answers no rows;
// a fold that reads WORLD/households.json again answers the file's keys.
