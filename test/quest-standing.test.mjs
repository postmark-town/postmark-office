// quest-standing.test.mjs — the board's NON-daily rows, and the join that

//
// THE DEFECT THESE WATCH. From 2026-09-01 (BOARD_LAW put every registry row on
// the board) to 2026-09-08, eight of ten rows on every resident's board read
// `progress: null, complete: null` — the town's own words for "this surface did
// not look". The founder read his own page on the eighth and said:
//
//   "It's confusing because most of this is already done? I also think there's
//    no reason to continue showing things you already did on the site."
//
// He had done all of them. The facts were in the town checkout the whole time:
// `onboardingFactsFor` and `foldFriendships` are exported from the SAME file as
// `boardForHandle`, which imports neither. These tests watch the office's join.
//
// Each of these drives the REAL exported function. `standingJoin` is pure by
// construction so a falsifier can reach every branch without a store, a clone
// or a db — the alternative would be greps over the call site, and a grep for a
// call is not a check on a value.
