// acts-pen-stub.mjs — the RECORD's write side, in memory, for suites that used
// to write a sqlite journal row.
//
// NOT A TEST FILE. The suite glob is `test/*.test.mjs`, so this is a helper and
// not a roster entry.
//
// ── WHY EVERY ACT-WRITING SUITE SUDDENLY NEEDS ONE (G1 / POS-156) ───────────
//
// `appendJournal` used to INSERT a sqlite row and queue a fire-and-forget copy
// into Postgres. G1 deleted the INSERT, and RULING 3 made what is left AWAITED
// and REFUSABLE — so a suite with no store no longer writes a row nobody reads,
// it gets `PenUnreachableError` and the door under test refuses.
//
// That is the correct behaviour and it is exactly what these suites must now be
// written against: the store IS the write, so a test that writes an act must
// point the office at a record. This is that record.
//
// ── IT IS A PEN, NOT A POSTGRES ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It answers the queries the WRITE path actually makes and nothing else:
// `officeWrite`'s transaction frame, `insertAct`'s one INSERT, and the three
// registry SELECTs `householdKeyFor` reaches through. A suite that also needs
// the docket (`claims`, `windows` — only mark-class rows go there,
// `claimEligible`) passes its own handlers in `also`.
//
// ⚑ AN UNKNOWN QUERY THROWS rather than answering `{ rows: [] }`. This is
// `test/stands-store-fixture.mjs`'s rule and it is the whole value of the
// thing: an empty answer to a question the stub does not understand is
// indistinguishable from "the record holds none", so a stub that shrugged
// would let a suite pass while the path under test asked for something nobody
// implemented. The throw names the SQL.
//
// ⚑ IT KEEPS WHAT IT WAS WRITTEN. `rows()` is the acts the suite's own door
// actually filed, in order, in the columns `insertAct` names — so an assertion
// can read back the thing that was written instead of trusting that a call
// returning no error wrote anything. `asked` counts every query, which is the
// leg an equality cannot supply: a door that quietly went back to sqlite would
// answer the same words and ask this pen NOTHING.
