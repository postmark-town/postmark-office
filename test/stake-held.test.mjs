// stake-held.test.mjs — A STAKE THAT HOLDS NOTHING IS NEVER FILED, and the
// docket shows what is held.
//
// ── THE BUG, AS THE TOWN LIVED IT (postmark-town/postmark #2686) ────────────
//
// A stake on a draft is two writes in one act, in this order on purpose
// (src/world-stake.mjs § THE BOUNDARY, ARRIVING ON ITS OWN):
//
//   1. `promoteDraftOnStake` flips the claim draft -> pending and records
//      `stake: n` — the number ASKED.
//   2. the stamp ledger moves liquid stamps into escrow — the only record of
//      what is HELD.
//
// The order is chosen so the recoverable failure is the one that can happen:
// "if the escrow write fails, a mark that is merely public-too-early can be
// retracted before the close, whereas stamps taken for a mark that never
// reached the docket are a debt with no receipt."
//
// Sophia held 0 and staked 1 on a commons mark. (1) succeeded. (2) moved 0 and
// said so in its own receipt ("your balance has no stamps free to stake", the
// town engine's words). The docket then showed `stake: 1` for nine hours,
// indistinguishable from a backed claim, and the candle refused it at the close
// as nothing staked (window 184, 2026-09-12 05:52Z). Correct judgment, wrong
// display, for nine hours.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE HOLDS TO ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The DECISION is pure and is falsified directly, the way `stakeRefusalFor`'s
// own header says a decision in this file must be: "PURE ON PURPOSE. The
// decision takes the three facts and returns the answer, so the falsifiers can
// put a retired mark in front of it without a database, and the door and the
// test cannot drift into two rules."
//
// The WIRING is falsified against `test/helpers/fake-pen.mjs` — a store that
// holds real rows in a real transaction — because "did the promotion actually
// come back off the docket" cannot be asked of a stub that swallows statements.
//
// The DISPLAY half is DERIVED, never stored (Keemin, 2026-09-12): the claim row
// says nothing about what is held, and `/world2/docket` reads the figure from
// `escrow_projection` through the candle's own `escrowPresenceAt`. So the two
// gates read one number, no claim is ever rewritten, and an unstake before the
// close shows up on the next read instead of leaving a stale snapshot.
//
// And the PARITY is asked of both predicates against ONE fixture, which is why
// `test/forecast-sweep-parity.test.mjs` exists: two filters, one rule, and they
// must not drift.
