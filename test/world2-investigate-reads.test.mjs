// world2-investigate-reads.test.mjs — `/world2/investigate?mark=`, held to 1.0's
// OWN engine over the same world, and made unable to go green off the tree
// (POS-104).
//
// ── THE ORACLE IS THE SAME FUNCTION, WHICH IS THE POINT ─────────────────────
//
// `GET /world/investigate` is `verbs.investigate(mark, w, { depth })` where `w`
// is the world folded from `WORLD/world-state.json`. The twin is
// `verbs.investigate(mark, w, { depth })` where `w` is the world assembled from
// `marks` ROWS. One judgment, two sources — so an equality here is about the
// ROWS and never about the engine, and a divergence names the seam rather than
// a difference of opinion between two implementations.
//
// The fixture world below is the SAME world twice: a `world-state.json`-shaped
// object for the oracle, and the `marks` rows a store holds for the same marks.
// `apex-reads.mjs § worldStateFromMarkRows` is the mapping under test.
//
// ── WHY AN EQUALITY ALONE WOULD BE WORTHLESS ────────────────────────────────
//
// A twin that quietly folded `WORLD_CLONE` would answer exactly what 1.0
// answers, and every equality would pass with the port doing nothing. So the
// fixture store carries a mark — `ghost/only-in-the-store` — that stands in NO
// tree: it is in the rows and nowhere else. If the twin's answer cannot see it,
// the twin is not reading the store. The fixture pool also COUNTS what it was
// asked, so a door that opened no `marks` query fails on the count alone.
//
// ── THE FLIP, run 2026-09-17 against commit `976b3de` of this branch ─────────
//
// In `src/world2-serve.mjs`'s `/world2/investigate` arm, point the twin at the
// tree: replace
//
//     const { rows: markRows } = await p.query(apex.MARK_ROWS_SQL);
//     const worldState = apex.worldStateFromMarkRows(markRows);
//
// with the folded tree the 1.0 door reads —
//
//     const worldState = (await import("./world-branches.mjs"))
//       .publishedState(WORLD_CLONE).state;
//
// — and 5 of these 11 go red (the three equalities and the two store legs). The
// one that names the CAUSE rather than a symptom is:
//
//   not ok 5 - THE PLANTED MARK: a mark that stands only in the store is investigable
//     error: |-
//       the twin could not find a mark that exists only in the rows — it is reading a tree
//       404 !== 200
//
// Restore with `git checkout -- src/world2-serve.mjs`.
//
// NEEDS `WORLD_CLONE` — the ENGINE is the world repo's and this office holds no
// vendored copy (`world2-serve.mjs § engine`: "the one open seam of this door").
// Without a clone the door answers 503 by design and these cases say so rather
// than passing quietly.
