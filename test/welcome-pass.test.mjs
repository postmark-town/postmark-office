// welcome-pass.test.mjs — the office drain that pays the welcome bundle.
//
// THE DEFECT THESE WATCH. The welcome bundle was founder-ruled 2026-09-14 — ✦5
// to every household, once, at its first resident — and three published surfaces
// said the office writes it at a crossing: the town's registry row (`awaits: the
// town's own hand — the office writes the bundle at a crossing`), the grammar
// note above `WELCOME_RE`, and the `--welcome` verb's own header. No such code
// existed. The crossing's mint pass is `stamp-mint.mjs --append`, which appends
// DERIVED mints only; a welcome is an in-place assertion the fold READS and
// never generates. Six households that joined after the 09-14 by-hand pass were
// reading a promise nothing scheduled would ever keep.
//
// Each test below drives the REAL exported function or the REAL town verb
// against a throwaway town — the parse against captured plan text, the mint
// against a synthetic clone carrying the town's own stamp-mint.mjs. Nothing
// here re-implements a town rule, which is the whole design of the pass.
