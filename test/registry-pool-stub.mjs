// registry-pool-stub.mjs — the store, in memory, for suites that used to seed a file.
//
// NOT A TEST FILE. The suite glob is `test/*.test.mjs`, so this is a helper and
// not a roster entry.
//
// ── WHY EVERY DRAIN SUITE SUDDENLY NEEDS ONE (POS-158) ──────────────────────
//
// The household registry is store-of-record (019_households.sql, POS-187), and
// POS-158 moved the last office readers and the last office writers onto it.
// `planTownDrain` reads `loadRegistry()`; `writeTownDrain` writes rows through
// `src/ceremony.mjs` and renders the files through `tools/registry-drain.mjs`.
//
// These suites were all written against the OLD shape: seed
// `tools/households.json` in a temp clone, run a crossing, read the file back.
// That intent is still exactly right — a crossing reads the town's registry and
// leaves it holding one more resident — so rather than rewrite twenty tests,
// this seeds THE STORE from the same fixture the test already wrote, and the
// file it wrote is then what the drain renders back.
//
// THE POOL IS STUBBED, NOT MOCKED AROUND. `world2-acts.mjs` exports
// `__setPoolForTest` for exactly this (it is how `registry-drain.test.mjs` has
// worked since POS-187), and this stub answers the REAL queries with rows
// shaped the way `node-postgres` shapes them: `gh_id` a STRING for a bigint,
// `ord` a number, and `accounts` parsed jsonb WITH ITS KEYS SORTED THE WAY
// JSONB SORTS THEM — see the reads below and `test/jsonb-key-order.mjs`. So the
// path under test stays the real `loadRegistryRows` -> `registryFromRows` ->
// the ceremony -> the drain, over the values the real column hands back.
//
// IT APPLIES THE WRITES. A stub that answered reads and swallowed upserts would
// let "the crossing settled them" pass while nothing was settled. The rows go
// into the same arrays the reads come out of, which is what makes a suite's
// "read it back" assertion mean something.
