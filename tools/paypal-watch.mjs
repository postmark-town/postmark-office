// paypal-watch — the PayPal rail, closed at both ends by rule (POS-183 part 2).
//
// The third money rail, for givers whose banks balk at a foreign USD card
// charge from an unfamiliar US merchant: PayPal is where they already hold a
// balance. It is tools/stripe-watch.mjs's contract on a second rail, and that
// file's header is the argument. What holds here, checked rather than assumed:
//
// 1. THE ORDER SAYS WHICH POT. The town's own fund page creates the PayPal
//    order with `purchase_units[0].custom_id = "<pot>|<handle>"`. PayPal
//    carries it onto the capture and into Transaction Search as `custom_field`.
//    Nobody types the pot; the PAGE the giver stood on writes it. A payment
//    that carries no pot, or a pot the town does not hold open, is journalled
//    `needs-pot` for the founder's hand, never guessed at.
//
// 2. THE HOUSEHOLD IS MINTED (POS-317, Keemin 2026-10-02). A signed-in giver's
//    order carries `<pot>|g<id>`, their GitHub account, which resolves through
//    src/fund-holder.mjs to their household and the one resident who holds its
//    stamps; an account no household holds is a gift. Older orders made before
//    that carry `<pot>|<handle>` and keep the rule below.
//
//    THE HAND IS TYPED, NEVER GUESSED (orders before POS-317). The handle after the `|` is the text the
//    giver typed in the same field the card path uses, trimmed. It resolves
//    through stripe-watch's own `resolveHand` (the exact-handle channel, then
//    the town's reviewed login pins), so one rule serves both rails. Anything
//    else is a gift under `outside:paypal`, which mints no holo.
//
// 3. THERE IS NO PAYER PASTE-PATH. `paypal:<transaction id>` is a ref only this
//    file mints, so there is no honest claim to front-run.
//
// ── THE WITNESS: TRANSACTION SEARCH, POLLED ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Measured on the sandbox app 2026-09-29 (G:/Starstory/docs/2026-09-29/rail/
// paypal/probe-witness.out): the capture webhook needs a public office
// endpoint and a subscription; Transaction Search (`GET /v1/reporting/
// transactions`) needs neither and matches this family's polling shape, but it
// answered 403 until the app's "Transaction search" feature is enabled (the
// founder's step). This reader is written to PayPal's documented response and
// proven against fixtures; its live-sandbox run waits on that feature.
//
// THE LAG. PayPal's own words: transactions "can take a maximum of three hours
// to appear" in search. So the cursor is NOT the newest transaction seen. It is
// the response's own `last_refreshed_datetime`: everything before it is in the
// index, and the next tick reads from there. A payment that appears late is
// therefore never behind the cursor. Re-reading the boundary is free, because
// the journal dedupes on transaction id and the ledger on ref.
//
// ── HOW ONE TRANSACTION RESOLVES ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   kind   a payment (event code T0006, PayPal Checkout; T0000–T0099, the
//          payment family) is decided. A reversal or refund (T11xx) is NEVER
//          dropped: it is the anomaly `refund`, naming the transaction it
//          reverses, for the founder's hand. The ledger has no row that
//          unwitnesses a dollar (stripe-watch § A REFUND AFTER THE FACT). Any
//          other code (fees, conversions, holds) is journalled as `not-a-gift`
//          and decides nothing.
//   paid   `transaction_status` S (success). P pending waits (`unpaid`, re-read
//          every tick); D denied, V reversed and F partially refunded are named.
//   usd    the transaction's own `transaction_amount`, which for an order the
//          page created in USD is USD. Anything else is `not-usd`, for the
//          founder: the town has no rate anywhere.
//   whole  whole dollars only; the cents are disclosed, as on the card rail.
//   pot    `custom_field` before the `|`, gated by the /fund door's own potGate.
//   cap    the /fund door's own fundGuards (D5), one copy of one rule.
//   when   one full crossing after the payment, as on the card rail: the grace
//          lets the operator round catch a mistyped handle before the one-shot
//          ref is spent.
//   again  the LEDGER decides: `foldPotReceipts` already holds `paypal:<id>`.
//
// SANDBOX MONEY. Sandbox transactions look exactly like live ones. The watcher
// knows which API it is reading (PAYPAL_ENV), and a sandbox transaction is the
// anomaly `testmode`, never a witness, unless the run is a --dry-run with
// --allow-sandbox (the lane's end-to-end proof, which writes nothing).
//
// Usage: node tools/paypal-watch.mjs [--state <state.json>] [--journal <j.jsonl>]
//                                    [--out <report.json>] [--clone <town-clone>]
//                                    [--since <ISO>] [--dry-run] [--allow-sandbox] [--json]
//                                    [--credentials <paypal-*.json>]
//
// Env: PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID, PAYPAL_SECRET  the app's REST credentials. On the box
//                   they live in /etc/postmark-paypal-watch.env (mode 600, the
//                   box convention); never committed. `--credentials <file>`
//                   reads the same pair from a { env, client_id, secret } file
//                   in-process, for a hand run; nothing from it is printed.
//      PAYPAL_ENV   live | sandbox. Required: a watcher that guessed which
//                   money it was reading would be guessing about the ledger.
//      PAYPAL_API   optional base URL, so the CLI can be driven end to end by a
//                   falsifier against a local server.
//      plus fund-exec's own: TOWN_CLONE, STAMP_KEY, TOWN_PUSH, BOT_NAME,
//                   BOT_EMAIL, TOWN_TZ, TOWN_LOCK.
