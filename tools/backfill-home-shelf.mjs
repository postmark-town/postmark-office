// backfill-home-shelf — mint the town's legacy HOME art through the media door.
//
// The ruling this serves (Keemin, 2026-08-21): residents hung art on their HOME
// pages long before the world had a media door, and "simply mailing residents to
// reupload images to our media is not an option." So the office does the
// carrying. The world repo's tools/home-image-select.mjs reads the town's own
// record and names each household's lead image; this tool hands those bytes to
// the media door and brings back the URLs a parcel mark may carry.
//
// THE MEDIA DOOR IS THE ONLY MINT. This tool composes no URL of its own and skips no
// check of the door's. Every entry goes through the SAME `uploadMedia` the
// REST door and the MCP tool land in (src/media.mjs) — same decodeImage size
// gate, same magic-byte sniff, same content-addressed key, same
// same-bytes-same-URL dedup, same per-household quota wall, same row in odb's
// `media` table. The URL in the output file is the string that handler returned
// and nothing else. There is no second validation lane here, and nothing here
// is reachable over HTTP: this is a CLI an operator runs on the box, so the
// door's auth is neither used nor weakened — the credential it would have
// checked is replaced by the operator already being root on the machine that
// holds the R2 keys.
//
// THE HOUSEHOLD IS THE DOOR'S ANSWER, NOT OURS — and it is a DIFFERENT
// vocabulary from the economy's, which is the trap this tool exists to not fall
// into. The media door keys on `key.household`, and the only place that string is
// ever minted is oauth.mjs `householdFor`: `ghLogin ?? String(ghId)`, from the
// town's pins. The ECONOMY's household key for the same resident is
// `gh:<id>` / `login:<x>` / `hh:<slug>` (src/households.mjs, stamp-mint's
// currentHouseholds) — a different string for the same house, and one that
// carries a colon, which `mediaUrlOk` and tools/mark-lint.mjs both refuse. A
// backfill keyed on the economy's answer would mint 61 URLs that no mark door
// in the town will accept and no viewer will draw.
//
// So this calls the door's own resolver with the door's own arguments, and
// passes the object it returns straight through as the key: same media path,
// same quota ceiling (its `handles` set is what the per-resident ceiling
// multiplies), same ledger grain as that resident's own upload. A handle the
// pins do not know is NAMED and skipped, never guessed into a household.
//
// Run on the box (where /etc/postmark-office.env holds the R2 credentials):
//   node tools/backfill-home-shelf.mjs \
//     --manifest <staging>/home-image-manifest.json --staging <staging> \
//     --town ./town-clone --oauth-db ./oauth.db --office-db ./office.db \
//     --out home-image-urls.json
//
// `--dry` proves the whole leg without credentials or a bucket: the R2 PUT is a
// mock that records its arguments, and the ledger is a THROWAWAY COPY of odb —
// so the reads that matter (what this household already holds, how much of its
// quota is spent) are the real current state, while nothing is written to the
// office's own DB. It reports exactly what a real run would write.
