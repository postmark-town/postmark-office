// WHAT WENT WRONG, because the shape of this tool follows from it. A berth
// becomes a white-pages address at a ferry crossing, and the office's drain
// (src/town-drain.mjs, via tools/town-drain-run.mjs) is what does it — it reads
// the TOWN LOG, settles the rows it finds there, and writes nothing of its own.
// That road is correct and it is not the road every berth arrived on. Before
// the town log, a declaration's registry row was stamped "Settling ashore is
// the Registrar's separate act" and a Meep settled it by hand through the town
// repo's own tools/settle.mjs. When the drain replaced that lane, the berths
// already standing had no rows in the new log to be found in, and nothing
// re-enrolled them. They did not fail to settle; they stopped being asked.
//
// castor-vale is the one this was measured on: anchored (socksandstardust, id
// 320524222 pinned in tools/github-ids.json), berthed 2026-08-24, no address 28
// days and ~56 crossings later — against its own door's promise of automatic
// settlement. 34 of 37 berths hold addresses. This closes the set.
//
// THE MISSING HALF IS ONLY THE WHITE PAGES. A stranded berth's household row
// already stands in tools/households.json, already lists the handle as a
// resident, already carries the since date, and its identity pin already
// landed (declare.mjs writes the pin ALWAYS, in the declaration's own commit).
// So this writes NO registry diff and mints NO pin — it writes the three files
// that were never written, and refuses by name any berth whose row is missing
// rather than inventing one. A registry diff here would be a second writer on
// the town's registry, next to the door and the drain.
//
// AND IT WRITES NOTHING OF ITS OWN. The file set comes from residency.mjs's
// `buildJoinFiles` — the same builder the join PR lane uses, the same one the
// drain uses, and (since POS-178) the same one the declare door uses. Four
// callers, one builder: a berth settled here lands the same bytes it would have
// landed at a crossing, because it is literally the same function.
//
// THE GANGWAY BINDS THIS TOOL TOO. HARBOR/GANGWAY.md is the town's circuit
// breaker on arrivals; planTownDrain checks it before every other judgment, and
// town-drain.mjs records what goes wrong when a settlement road forgets it:
// "a founder could raise the gangway and a crossing would settle join rows
// straight past it. The breaker was on the old pipe." A sweep is a third pipe.
// Frozen ⇒ this refuses entirely and settles nobody.
//
// EXIT CODES (a FILE-safe contract — the caller may be reading $?):
//   0  the plan printed (dry run), or the apply landed, or verify found the
//      set closed
//   1  REFUSED — the gangway is raised, the clone is not a town checkout, or
//      --verify found a berth still stranded
//   2  a bad argument
//
// --dry-run IS THE DEFAULT AND --apply IS THE ONLY WRITER. Running this with no
// flags cannot change a byte.
