// usdc-watch — the town's eye on its own intake address, and its rules.
//
// The /fund door is patron-driven: money moves on Base, and the town learns of
// it only when the patron comes back and pastes the hash. Until they do, the
// town is blind to its own money. This watch closes the SEEING half of that gap
// — it reads Base on a clock and reports every USDC arrival at the intake
// address, whether or not anyone has claimed it.
//
// ── WHAT CHANGED, 2026-08-25: SEEING BECAME RESOLVING ───────────────────────
//
// The argument below (why a watcher may not simply witness what it sees) is
// unchanged and still governs. What changed is that its two premises are now
// FALSIFIABLE PER ARRIVAL instead of true by default, so the arrivals for which
// neither holds resolve by rule and only the rest surface:
//
//   the pot   an ERC-20 transfer carries no memo, so a watcher choosing a pot
//             would be guessing at a stranger's intent with their money. It
//             still would — UNLESS the address itself names the pot.
//             deploy/intake-addresses.json is that map. Today it is empty of
//             pots on purpose: one intake address, two open pots behind it, so
//             every arrival is pot-ambiguous and stays so. When the founder
//             mints a per-pot address, the chain names the pot and the guess
//             disappears rather than being made.
//
//   the hand  witnessing under a placeholder payer permanently destroys the
//             real patron's holo, because "ref is unique forever: one dollar,
//             one mint chance, a re-recorded receipt bounces" and the ledger
//             has no row kind that attaches, corrects, or reassigns a payer.
//             That is still exactly true of an UNKNOWN payer. It is NOT true of
//             a REGISTERED one: the OFFICE-SIDE registry (src/wallet-registry.mjs,
//             box-side and never in the town repo — founder-ruled 2026-08-25)
//             says whose address this is, so the claim the watch "front-runs"
//             would have named the same hand. There is no holo to lose.
//
// Both must hold for one arrival before it is witnessed, and it waits MIN_CONF
// deep AND one full crossing besides. test/usdc-watch.test.mjs still proves the
// theft against the town's own CLI for the placeholder case, because that case
// is still forbidden.
//
// THE ONE LIBERTY AUTO-WITNESS TAKES, named rather than buried: the /fund door
// lets a resident witness a payment under ANY handle they choose — a household
// may fund on someone else's behalf. Auto-witness files it under the wallet's
// own household. The crossing-long grace is what makes that safe to live with:
// a resident who wants a different attribution has a full crossing to use the
// door first, and their paste wins outright, because the door consumes the ref
// and the next tick reads it back as already witnessed.
//
// AND THE ASYMMETRY WITH THE CARD RAIL, which is deliberate. tools/stripe-watch.mjs
// witnesses an unattributable card payment as an outside gift (`outside:stripe`)
// because that rail has no payer paste-path to front-run — the fund page says so
// in its own words: "Step 2 — there isn't one". Base HAS one. So an arrival from
// an unregistered address is NEVER witnessed as a gift here, however clearly the
// address names its pot: doing so would spend the ref of a patron who is about
// to paste. It stays unclaimed, and the sink rule below is the eventual answer.
//
// ── THE SINK RULE (PROPOSED — NOT ENABLED) ──────────────────────────────────
//
// An unclaimed arrival from an unregistered address, older than SINK_AGE_DAYS,
// would witness as an outside gift to the DARKO fund — the donation box is the
// natural home for money nobody claimed, and its own file says "Nothing is ever
// refused at intake." This is IMPLEMENTED AND OFF. It runs only when the
// environment sets USDC_SINK_UNCLAIMED=1, which is the founder's flip and
// nobody else's. Every report lists what the rule WOULD take and states that it
// is off, so the decision is made on real numbers rather than in the abstract.
//
// WHAT IT REPORTS, per run:
//   witnessed   — arrivals whose ref is already a pot-receipt in the ledger.
//   witness     — arrivals resolved fully by rule and recorded this tick.
//   hold        — resolved, but not yet a crossing old; carries the plan.
//   needs_pot   — a registered payer at an address that names no single pot.
//   over_cap    — resolved, but past the pot's posted target (D5).
//   unclaimed   — real money nobody has attached to a hand. The operator's queue.
//   sink        — what the (disabled) sink rule would take, and that it is off.
//   dust        — arrivals under $1, carrying the door's own sentence.
//
// THE CURSOR is a block number, and it only ever advances over blocks that are
// MIN_CONF deep — the same depth the door demands ("confirmations >= MIN_CONF;
// finality is a claim about depth, not existence"). A run that cannot reach Base
// exits loud, reports nothing, and leaves the cursor exactly where it was, so
// the next run re-reads the same range rather than stepping over it.
//
// Usage: node tools/usdc-watch.mjs [--state <state.json>] [--out <report.json>]
//                                  [--clone <town-clone>] [--from <block>]
