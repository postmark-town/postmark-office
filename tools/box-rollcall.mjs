// box-rollcall — the roll-call of every mechanism that is supposed to be RUNNING.
//
// Built 2026-08-27 to close a failure class the town hit three times in one week,
// and the founder's sentence is the whole specification:
//
//     "A box roll-call exists: a manifest of every unit that must run with its
//      expected heartbeat, a checker that emits ALARM for missing or stale,
//      wired into my daily operator round … OPERATIONS.md carries the law: a
//      mechanism folds only with its runner, its liveness check, and its
//      activation owner named. 'Built' is not 'done.'"
//
// ── THE FAILURE CLASS, WITH ITS RECEIPTS ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Machinery gets BUILT and never RUN, and nothing anywhere goes red. Four
// instances, all live on 2026-08-27 when this file was written:
//
//  1. THE WORLD DRAIN NEVER HAD A RUNNER (postmark#1990). The function existed,
//     was correct, was tested, and had no caller — marks aged 2+ days in a
//     journal nobody drained.
//  2. THE SETTLEMENT SHADOW IS DISABLED AND ITS VERDICT IS ROTTING.
//     postmark-settlement-shadow.timer is `disabled` on the box; the verdict on
//     disk at /srv/postmark-harbor/settlement-shadow.json reads
//     {"at":"2026-08-24T22:23:00Z","status":"would-refuse"} — a WOULD-REFUSE, the
//     exact finding the shadow exists to raise — 2 days 8 hours old when it was
//     measured, and unread by anything the whole time. Its own script header says
//     the verdict is "polled by the ops page and
//     read on the operator round"; no step of the operator round reads it. That
//     sentence has been false since the day it was written.
//  3. THE ECONOMY REPORT'S TIMER IS OWED, and OPERATIONS.md § Known gaps has
//     said so since 2026-08-10 without anything alarming about it.
//  4. THE STRIPE WATCHER — this one is the CONTROL, and it is why PARKED is a
//     first-class verdict here. It was built 2026-08-25 and is not installed on
//     the box; that is correct and deliberate (its unit file says "STAGE B. NOT
//     INSTALLED, NOT ENABLED, INERT UNTIL ADOPTED"). A roll-call that simply
//     omitted it would make a deliberate parking indistinguishable from an
//     oversight — which is the same blindness one layer up.
//
// The one thing all four share: THERE WAS NO SURFACE ON WHICH THE ABSENCE OF A
// RUNNER WAS VISIBLE. Every other check in this repo asks whether a thing that
// ran produced the right answer. This one asks whether it ran at all.
//
// ── THE FOUR DESIGN RULES, EACH BOUGHT WITH A MEASUREMENT ───────────────────
//
// 1. A HEARTBEAT IS ONLY EVIDENCE OF A RUNNER IF THE RUNNER EXISTS AND IS
//    ENABLED. Measured on the box 2026-08-27: /srv/postmark-office/.stripe-watch-state.json
//    carried last_run 2026-08-27T04:04:34Z — four minutes fresh — while
//    postmark-stripe-watch.timer did not exist on the machine at all. A hand-run
//    wrote it. A checker that ranked freshness first would have called a rail
//    with no runner healthy, on the strength of a file a human touched. So the
//    unit is judged BEFORE the heartbeat, always, and a stale-looking heartbeat
//    on a dead unit reports the dead unit.
//
// 2. THE CADENCE COMES FROM `systemctl show`, NEVER FROM THE TIMER FILE. Measured
//    on the box 2026-08-27: /etc/systemd/system/postmark-dev-freshen.timer says
//    `OnCalendar=*:0/10` and even calls itself "every 10 minutes" in its own
//    Description — while the drop-in at .timer.d/nightly.conf clears that line and
//    substitutes `OnCalendar=*-*-* 08:10:00 UTC`. The effective cadence is DAILY.
//    A checker reading the file would have been wrong by a factor of 144 and would
//    have alarmed on a healthy rail every ten minutes forever. `systemctl show
//    -p TimersCalendar` returns the merged, effective value; that is the only
//    number this file will believe. (Sibling of the site-sentinel's own scar: its
//    stripe_watch probe once quoted a cadence the box did not run.)
//
// 3. A LIVE ROW THAT DECLARES NO STALENESS ALLOWANCE IS ITSELF AN ALARM. This is
//    instance 2 above, generalised. The shadow's verdict file has no field saying
//    when it goes off, so nothing on the box or in the repo could ever have said
//    it was old — it was served stale for sixty hours and every surface that
//    touched it reported exactly what it said. An un-allowanced heartbeat is not
//    a healthy heartbeat; it is a heartbeat nobody can check, and ALARM-unbounded
//    exists so that a lazily-written manifest row fails loudly instead of quietly
//    passing forever.
//
// 4. THE ROLL-CALL IS TWO-DIRECTIONAL. A manifest row with no unit is one failure
//    (something we swore would run, does not). A unit with no manifest row is the
//    OTHER failure, and it is the one that grows silently: every unit installed
//    after this file was written is invisible to the roll-call until someone adds
//    it. So the collector globs the box for every postmark-* timer and every
//    ENABLED postmark-* service, and anything it finds that the manifest does not
//    name is ALARM-unmanifested. That is what keeps the roll-call from decaying
//    into a snapshot of 2026-08-27.
//
// ── WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It reads and reports. It never enables, disables, restarts, or writes a unit.
// Detection is mechanical here; the repair stays a hand — the same posture as
// harbor-watch and site-sentinel, and for the same reason (the 2026-08-19
// stranded-crossings incident is the town's receipt for an unwatched automatic
// hand).
//
// It also cannot see its own death, and NEITHER CAN IT SEE THE BOX'S. It runs on
// the box; if the box is down it does not run and therefore does not alarm. That
// is the classic watchman problem and it is NOT solved here — solving it needs an
// off-box heartbeat, which is a second machine. Named rather than papered over,
// because a roll-call that implies coverage it does not have is worse than none.
// What the wiring DOES give: the operator round runs it over ssh once a day, so a
// box that cannot be reached fails the ssh and the operator sees that instead.
//
// ── SHAPE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `collect()` is the only impure part: it shells out to systemctl and stat. Every
// judgment lives in `rollcall()`, which is a pure function of (manifest, snapshot,
// now) — so the falsifiers plant a healthy snapshot as a fixture, break exactly
// one thing, and watch exactly one row go red.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs                          # collect on the box, judge, print
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --snapshot snap.json     # judge a captured snapshot
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --dump-snapshot snap.json # collect, save, AND judge
//   node tools/box-rollcall.mjs --json                   # machine-readable
// Exit: 0 = every row OK or PARKED · 1 = at least one ALARM · 2 = the roll-call
// itself could not run (no manifest, unreadable manifest, systemctl absent).

  // absence into every receipt rather than failing the crossing — and that is
  // the right failure and exactly the shape nobody reads. A named absence
  // repeated twice a day forever is indistinguishable from a quiet town unless
  // something is counting, which is the `left_drafted` lesson one rule up.
  //
  // NULL AND ZERO ARE DIFFERENT FACTS AND ONLY ONE OF THEM ALARMS.
  // deploy/settlement-history.mjs writes `retired: <n>` when the step ran and
  // `retired: null` when it did not. A crossing that ran and retired nothing is
  // a normal, common, green crossing — most are. A crossing that never asked is
  // the register drifting from canon with nothing saying so. Alarming on `0`
  // would fire on almost every crossing and teach the board to be ignored.
  //
  // A MISSING FIELD IS NOT A NULL. History lines written before this field
  // existed have no `retired` key at all, and `undefined` deliberately does not
  // match: an old log must not alarm about a step that did not exist when it was
  // written. The rule therefore judges only crossings that ran the code that
  // reports it, and it starts judging on its own as soon as they do — no
  // install-day exception needed, unlike its sibling above.
  //
  // IT CARRIES ITS OWN `means`, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE SEPARATE FIELD.
  // The shared `spec.means` above ends with an INSTALL-DAY NOTE — "this row is
  // EXPECTED to read ALARM-outcome until the first crossing after deploy writes
  // the log, and it clears itself then" — which is true of its siblings and
  // FALSE here: a missing `retired` key does not match, so this rule is silent
  // on an old log and has no install day to be excused for. Appending the
  // shared sentence would have handed the operator an excuse for the one alarm
  // that never needs one, which is how a real finding gets read as expected
  // noise. `retire_means` names the box carry instead.

  // unseen for three weeks because NOTHING WAS LOOKING — not because anything
  // was quiet about it — so the alarm is the list itself, not a trend across
  // runs: one name in it is a disagreement between the two records standing
  // right now, and by the time it repeats it has already been true for twelve
  // hours.
  //
  // JUDGED ON THE LATEST LINE ONLY, and that is the difference from every rule
  // above. `left_drafted` and `retired` are about a rail's BEHAVIOUR over time,
  // where one bad crossing is noise; this is about the STORE'S STATE, where the
  // most recent reading is the only one that is still true.
  //
  // A LATEST LINE CARRYING NONE OF THE NAMED FIELDS IS ITSELF THE ALARM, and it
  // is deliberately not the `retired` rule's silent-on-a-missing-key shape. That
  // discipline is right for a field a rail grew into; it is wrong here, because
  // "silent when the field is absent" means a writer that stops emitting the list
  // turns its own alarm off. The judge says so instead.
  // IT CARRIES ITS OWN `means`, FOR THE REASON `retire_means` DOES ONE RULE UP
  // AND FOR A SHARPER ONE. The shared `spec.means` ends with an INSTALL-DAY NOTE
  // — "this row is EXPECTED to read ALARM-outcome until the first crossing after
  // deploy appends to the log, and it clears itself then" — which is true of the
  // empty-log case above and FALSE here: a line naming a slug is never install-day
  // noise. Appending it would hand the operator a ready-made excuse for the one
  // alarm that has no excuse, which is how a real finding gets skimmed past. I
  // wrote it the other way first and the end-to-end run on the box showed the
  // excuse attached to `lupi/the-drift-room`; this is that repair.
  // THE LIST RULE AND THE FLAG RULE BOTH SPEAK (lap 5, the lap-4 reviewer's
  // LOW). Until this lap the judge returned the FIRST rule's sentence, so while
  // `canon_absent` carried a slug — prod's condition since window 177,
  // `lupi/the-drift-room` — the list alarm returned and `unchecked_means` never
  // printed: the operator was told about lupi and NOT told that the escrow half
  // of the read has never run. Repair 2 closed the day lupi settles; this closes
  // the days before it, which are the days between merge and that settlement.
  // The board's reason is one string that already carries a paragraph of
  // `means`, so two sentences fit; the list sentence stays FIRST — the finding,
  // then the caveat on it. The class-terminal and stuck rules above still return
  // alone: they describe a rail that did not produce a line worth judging, and

 * THE COUNT THAT IS NOT AN ALARM (postmark#2935).

 * beside the row's verdict and never alarms on. The case it exists for: the
 * notary's escrow read judges each commons mark at the town sha of the window
 * that locked it, and the projection holds no rows for any window before 181 —
 * so 227 marks locked at windows 150–179 read ESCROW-ABSENT every morning for
 * eight nights, while the number of true unbacked marks was zero. An alarm that
 * is always on teaches its reader to skim, which is the failure `list_means`'s
 * own paragraph names. Those marks are UNJUDGEABLE, not ✦0 (the doorstep's
 * rule): a count, with its one sentence, on the same line as the verdict.
 *
 * A field that is not a number on the latest line is said so, in words, and is
 * still not an alarm: a writer that stops emitting a count loses a count line,
 * not a verdict — the alarms above keep their own "carries none of them" rule
 * for the lists, whose absence IS the alarm. `null` is the read's own word for
 * "the projection was not checked, so nothing was counted", which is not zero.
 *
 * Returns the line, or null when the row declares no counts or has no history
