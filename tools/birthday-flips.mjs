  // ── the two defects the apex suite found in THIS lane's own code ─────────

  // by a test I did not write. A defect that was only ever found once is a
  // defect nothing is watching for.
  // ⚠ ONE FLIP, NOT TWO, AND THE RUNNER IS WHY.
  //
  // I first wrote these as two flips — one per defect — and BOTH came back
  // green. That is the finding, not a nuisance:
  //
  //   · restoring only the poor-entry builder is invisible, because with the
  //     works clause in place the fixture's class marks are correctly read as
  //     DECLARATIONS, so the ground channel yields no entries there at all and
  //     the builder has nothing to build. The guard cannot reach its subject.
  //   · restoring only the stamp-only declaration test is invisible, because
  //     the ground entries it wrongly conjures up are now RICH — built through
  //     `entriesFrom` — so the four tests see the shape they expect.
  //
  // The defects were only ever JOINTLY visible, which is exactly how they got
  // in: each looks harmless beside the other's correct half. So the flip
  // applies both, and the honest statement of coverage is this — the apex suite
  // guards the CONJUNCTION. The entry-shape property has no independent
  // falsifier, because this fixture's class marks all stand in the works and it
  // therefore cannot produce a ground-granted entry to inspect. A fixture with
  // a classed instance OUTSIDE the works is what that guard needs, and it is
  // named here rather than left for someone to assume exists.
