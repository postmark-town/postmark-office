// registry-backfill.mjs — EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE ROLL GETS EXACTLY ONE ROW.
//
// RULED (Keemin, 2026-09-22, POS-159). The town's roll is its ADDRESS cards:
// one `WHITE_PAGES/<handle>/ADDRESS.md` per resident, each naming the house it
// belongs to. The registry is the store (019/020/021, POS-187 + POS-158). This
// tool is the one place those two are reconciled, and it reconciles them in ONE
// direction only: a house the ROLL holds and the REGISTRY does not gets a row.
//
// It never edits a standing row, never removes one, and never touches a
// resident's card. The registry is store-of-record and the cards are what
// residents wrote; a tool that "fixed" either from the other would be a second
// writer with no receipt, which is the thing POS-187 exists to end.
//
// ── WHAT IT DOES TODAY: NOTHING, AND IT SAYS SO ─────────────────────────────
//
// Measured 2026-09-22 (town `origin/main` 1cd13ff57): 188 residents on the
// roll, 0 houses without a row, so `--dry-run` plans 0 and `--apply` writes 0.
// That is the answer, not a failure, and the dry run prints the roads every
// resident was found by so a reader can tell "everybody has a row" apart from
// "the roll did not load". The 09-21 note's "3 of 119" does not reproduce; the
// gap is that 24 residents state a household LABEL the registry does not carry
// as a slug, and all 24 are found by their account.
//
// ── THE ROLL IS READ FROM A CHECKOUT, AND THE CARDS ARE MIXED EOL ───────────
//
// `--town <path>` is an ordinary working checkout (default the office's own
// town clone). MEASURED AND IT CHANGED THE ANSWER: the town's cards are not all
// LF — `sable`'s is CRLF in the blob, and on Windows every card is CRLF after a
// checkout, because git applies the line-ending filter on the way out. A
// frontmatter reader whose value pattern ends in `$` does not match a line with
// a carriage return on it, and a card read that way looks like a card that
// states no household — a silent hole in the roll, in the exact shape this tool
// exists to count. So the reader normalises before it parses, and the dry run
// prints how many cards arrived CRLF.
//
// ── USAGE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   node tools/registry-backfill.mjs --dry-run [--town <path>]
//   node tools/registry-backfill.mjs --apply   [--town <path>]
//
// WORLD2_PG=1 + WORLD2_PG_URL point the office at the record (role
// `office_api`). Nothing is sourced and no secret is printed.
//
// `--apply` REFUSES, without writing anything:
//   · when the office is not pointed at the record;
//   · when the store is EMPTY — the seed has not run, every slug looks free,
//     and a backfill against an empty roll would mint 100-odd duplicate houses
//     over the live registry. NULL IS NOT EMPTY and EMPTY IS NOT READY;
//   · when the plan carries any refusal (a house whose every borrowable key is
//     taken, or whose first resident's handle is not a lawful key);
//   · when any planned slug is taken, re-checked at the moment of writing.
//
// IT IS IDEMPOTENT. A second `--apply` plans zero, because the rows the first
// one wrote carry their residents and their first resident's account, and the
// planner finds a house by account, by name AND by the residents array
// (`src/registry-backfill.mjs` § THREE ROADS TO A HOUSE).
