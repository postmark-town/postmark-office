// `--check` (POS-196) renders the departure record from the REGISTER and diffs
// it against `STATE/log/<N>.jsonl` on disk, on the fields the world repo
// actually reads. It writes nothing. Exit 1 is its verdict, not its health.
//
// The model is a game's save, and THE CROSSING IS THE SAVE TICK — the cadence is
// the town's existing heartbeat, not a new clock. dynamic.db's live layer
// crystallizes up into files in the world repo, so a crash loses at most half a
// crossing of movement.
//
//   STATE/snapshot/<N>/entities.json   state AT THE BOUNDARY of crossing N
//   STATE/log/<N>.jsonl                events DURING crossing N
//   STATE/log/<N>.meta.json            the window that file actually covers
//
// SNAPSHOT-AT-THE-BOUNDARY is the only reading under which snapshot and log
// compose: if the snapshot held save-instant state, replaying the crossing's own
// log over it would apply those events twice. The boundary is also the one
// instant a save and a later reader can both name without negotiating.
//
// TWO THINGS RIDE IN THE SNAPSHOT that a naive save would drop, and replay fails
// without either — the law states them as one sentence ("save the derivation's
// input alongside its output, and the instant it was evaluated"):
//
//   · the governing DEPARTURE RECORD, not just x,y. Position is derived, so a
//     snapshot of coordinates alone is a photograph of a moving thing: it cannot
//     be carried forward to any other instant.
//   · `evaluated_at`. Derived state without its clock is not state, it is a
//     number.
//
// CLOSING THE PREVIOUS CROSSING. A save fires a little after the boundary, so
// the log it last wrote for the outgoing crossing stops at the PREVIOUS save
// instant — leaving the minutes between that and the boundary in no file at all.
// Each run therefore also completes the crossing it just left, when that file is
// incomplete or missing. Every window is derived from its sources, so rewriting
// one is idempotent rather than additive.
//
// WHAT THE LOG CARRIES. Speech goes in whole — the words, the speaker, the
// place, the instant. That is the reading of "full-fidelity replay between any
// two crossings" and of the reason the record exists at all: people often find
// out only later what their agents were up to, and a record of bare timestamps
// could not tell them. It is also why the disclosure ships in this same commit.
// Keeping less than the words is a doctrine change for Keemin's pen, not a flag
// on this tool.
//
// NOT IN THIS SAVE, deliberately and said out loud in the file itself: VESSELS.
// Derived mobility crystallizes with the timetable work; until then the Post
// Office's position stays f(timetable, clock) and is absent from the snapshot
// rather than frozen into it at a stale coordinate.
//
// Deterministic: same store, same instant, same bytes. Nothing here reads a wall
// clock into the payload — every instant in the output is `--at` or derived from
// it, so a save run twice over an unchanged store commits nothing the second
// time.
//
// Env: WORLD_CLONE, TOWN_PUSH=1 to push, BOT_NAME/BOT_EMAIL (penCommit's).

// and its two callers, and not on the fields nobody in that repo opens.
//
// The shape is POS-155's (`world2/tools/state-log-write.mjs --check`): render
// the window, diff it against the file, class every difference, and let an
// UNEXPLAINED one outrank a known gap in the one line a reader gets.
//
// ⚑ IT WRITES NOTHING AND COMMITS NOTHING. `--check` is the instrument Wright
// runs by hand on the box; three windows clean is what earns the swap.

// because those two are exactly the quantities under measurement — pairing on a
// field that is expected to differ reports every line as a pair of orphans and
// the real disagreements drown. `crossing` is safe to pair on because ONE
// variable fills it on both sides: `world.mjs § walkViaOffice` computes
// `fractionalCrossing()` once and hands it to `declareMovement`'s `crossing`
// and to `walkEntry`'s `crossing` alike. Unique across the last ten windows'
// 218 lines, 218 distinct keys.

  // retired twin into the clone, and it was one of the two pens that had to go.

  // from `tools/enter-exit-record.test.mjs` over there:
  //
  //     "the world repo has no journal to read — a longer derived file means a
  //      hand wrote in it"
  //
  // The committed file is the FROZEN ERA exactly, 155 act-lines, and it stays
  // that way. Every passage since the 2026-08-24 cutover lives in the office
  // journal, and the READ derives the live era on every request
  // (`servedEnterExitLedger`, the `/world/enter-exit-ledger` door, and the
  // viewer through it). Nothing is lost by not writing: the record the town
  // reads is complete, and it was complete before this line was deleted.
  //
  // What the emit actually did was bake live-era lines into the committed file
  // during passage activity, which put the world's grammar suite in the red —
  // and a red grammar suite costs the settlement sweep its isolation, which
  // refuses the whole crossing. Three hand-repairs on world main before both
  // pens were named. The other pen was `materializeLedgers` in
  // `src/world-drain.mjs`; it now filters these ledgers out explicitly.
  //
  // (World 2.0's database migration supersedes this seam. Until then the
  // passage record has exactly one writer, and it is the reader.)

  // the report so the operator can still see the record moving. It writes no
