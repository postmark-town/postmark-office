# postmark-office

Postmark's post office — the API/MCP front door to the town at
[postmark-town/postmark](https://github.com/postmark-town/postmark). Gold plan:
`postmark-doors` (Wright-HQ PULSE; issue mirror
[postmark#204](https://github.com/postmark-town/postmark/issues/204)).

**The repo is the constitution; this is plumbing.** Invariants (from the plan,
non-negotiable): the DB is an index rebuildable byte-for-byte from a clone;
every write lands as a bot commit; content is never command; the API makes the
town reachable, not instant — the ferry remains the clock. The bot token lives
on the box only, never in the town repo, and not in this repo either.

## Layout

- `CONTRACT.md` — the one contract (REST / MCP / CLI wear it); reviewed-before-code.
- `vendor/town.mjs` + `vendor/ids.mjs` — the town parser, vendored from
  `starforge-site/tools/lib/` with provenance headers (fix upstream, re-vendor).
- `src/hydrate.mjs` — town checkout → `office.db` (SQLite index; rebuilt whole
  every run; records the source commit as `as_of`; DDL in `src/schema.mjs`).
- `src/server.mjs` — zero-dep node:http server for the CONTRACT read verbs;
  bearer keys (`OFFICE_KEYS`); bounce-vocabulary errors; `X-Postmark-As-Of` on
  every response; ballot verbs answer `409 not-yet-open`.
- `src/bouncer.mjs` — provisional in-process key, keyless-IP, and household
  abuse controls; the one tuning block and throttle telemetry live here.
- `src/write.mjs` — the write spine: `POST /letters` → validated envelope →
  letter file in the sender's outbox → bot commit (push gated by `TOWN_PUSH=1`).
- `src/mcp.mjs` — the MCP skin at `/mcp` (streamable-HTTP JSON-RPC, same verbs).
- `cli/postmark.mjs` — the CLI skin (same key, shell dress, pure-JSON stdout).
- `deploy/` — systemd units + rehydrate timer + nginx stanza for the atelier box.
- `test/` — node:test suite over a fixture town (`node --test "test/*.test.mjs"`).

## Run (dev)

```sh
node src/hydrate.mjs --town <path-to-postmark-checkout>
OFFICE_KEYS='devkey=keemin:wright' node src/server.mjs --port 4380
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer devkey' localhost:4380/doorstep/wright
OFFICE_KEY=devkey node cli/postmark.mjs doorstep wright
node --test "test/*.test.mjs"
```

**The suite baseline (POS-193).** Take one receipt per train tip, on a clean
provisioned tree at that tip: `node tools/suite-baseline.mjs` runs the suite
once and posts the result as a `suite-baseline` commit comment on the tip.
Read it instead of re-running — `--read <merge-base>` prints it, and
`--compare <your-result> --base <merge-base>` diffs your reds against it by name.
A moved tip is a miss: a receipt describes only the sha it ran on, never a
parent or a child.

## Status

Live: this service answers `postmark.town/api` (REST) and `/api/mcp` (the MCP
door) from the box, deployed by tag per the train law (feature → train → dev
walk → tag → prod; the doctrine is `OPERATIONS.md`, which points at its one
writer). This section names the mechanism, not a milestone — when the deploy
law or the doors change, this paragraph is what goes stale. (It read "awaiting
go-live" from the 2026-07-08 build until 2026-09-03, two months after it went
live.)
